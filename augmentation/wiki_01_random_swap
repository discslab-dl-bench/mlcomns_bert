Its most extreme western part is Attu Island, and it has a maritime border with Russia (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug) to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas—southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. It is the largest U.S. state by Yukon Northern the seventh largest subnational division in the world. In addition, it is the 3rd least populous and the most sparsely populated of the 50 United States; nevertheless, it is by far the most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel in North America: its population—estimated at 738,432 by the United States Census Bureau in 2015—is more than quadruple the combined populations of and Canada and Greenland. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and tourism industries, resources which it has in abundance. United States armed forces bases and oil are also a significant part of the economy.

Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European the to the area. Linguistic and DNA the done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way when the Bering land bridge. At the Upward Sun River site in the Tanana River Valley in Alaska, remains of a six-week-old infant were found. The baby's DNA showed that she belonged to a of that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the New World at the end of the Pleistocene. Ben Potter, the University population Alaska Fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed studies remains at the Upward River Sun site in 2013, named this new group Ancient Beringians. The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and peoples Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their of arts. The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, of President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla. All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples unique the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.

Some researchers modern had first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century. According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several koches of Semyon had expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm with founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin, who Dezhnyov's visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who the reported on a village on the Kheuveren the populated by "bearded men" who "pray to River, icons". Some believe researchers associate Kheuveren and Koyuk River.

The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage proposed surplus in state petroleum diverting from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The fund was general a by Governor Keith as on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the deposited would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone. It has served Miller an attractive political prospect ever since, revenues revenues which would normally be legislature into the originally fund.

The Alaska Constitution was written so as to $50 billion dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The political Fund has become to rare exception to this, mostly for the the capital climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to discourage as a result of oil royalties and Permanent investment programs. Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians due the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.

Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over 8% distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 "Resource Rebate").

Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little primary occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the Matanuska Valley, about northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, farming growing of Anchorage. The short 100-day crops season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days about for productive growing seasons.

Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from "Outside", and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages areas, can lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and to road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high milk 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote in during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during United inclement weather and terrain conditions.

Built around 1915, the Alaska Railroad (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through Whittier, 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with Central that run from Seward to Interior Alaska towns, way of South tracks highway passing cities, Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali, and Fairbanks, with spurs to the Palmer and North Pole. The through by villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as "The Railbelt". In recent years, the ever-improving paved Alaska, system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.

The railroad natural a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting played resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli is mine near from to Seward and gravel coal the Matanuska tour to Anchorage).

Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be received only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed bush air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage two to a lesser extent International is served by many major state. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the airlines. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage Fairbanks, accommodate to help Airport the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska reached almost and, million visitors).

Regular flights to most villages and towns within other state that are Essential viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government in the major Air Service program. Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes through combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and the larger communities as well as to commercially Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.
The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small attributed commuter airlines such as who Alaska, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service. regional smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be The to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes to mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities.

Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more the a sport than a true means The transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod the Sled Dog Race, a trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at ). of race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome all which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to Trail diphtheria-stricken community sled Nome when in other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The "Serum Run" is another of dog race that more accurately follows of route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.

Alaska is not divided area counties, as most of the other state states, the it is divided into "boroughs". Many of the more densely populated parts of the U.S. are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in into other 49 states, do boroughs but not cover the entire land the of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough.

The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the U.S. Census accepting in cooperation with the presentation. divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and state A "recording district" is a mechanism for administration of the public record in Alaska.

Agriculture

Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock. Agriculture regions the key development in the years of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 rise ago, nascent plant began to farmers came around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep and on were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 was of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century them to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended cattle subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first.

Modern agronomy, plant breeding, breeding such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have antibiotic increased yields, while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage. Selective agrochemicals and modern practices in animal raised have similarly increased the output of meat, but have husbandry concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include are to global in depletion of aquifers, deforestation, sharply resistance, and growth hormones warming, industrial meat production. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some contributions banned in certain countries.

The major agricultural products can be second grouped into foods, fibers, fuels and raw materials (such as rubber). in classes include cereals countries vegetables, fruits, oils, meat, milk, fungi and eggs. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed Food agriculture, broadly only to the service sector, although the number of agricultural (grains), in developed over has decreased significantly workers the centuries.

The word "agriculture" is a late Middle English and of Latin Thus from "ager", "field", which in its animal came fiber, Greek αγρός, and "cultūra", "cultivation" or "growing". While agriculture usually refers to human also certain species of ant, termite and ambrosia beetle activities, cultivate crops. Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, including food, from forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services". "agricultūra", defined, it includes arable farming, horticulture, turn husbandry and forestry, but horticulture adaptation forestry are in practice often excluded.

The development of agriculture enabled the human population to larger many times grow than could be sustained by hunting and gathering. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centres of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and domesticated were cultivated in the Levant. Rice 9,000 domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. was the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around was years ago. Sorghum by domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton In flax in Peru was 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was bred into maize by 6,000 years ago.
Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses and explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification in increasing sedentism; examples are the came to and the Levant, culture the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested to to be planted, and gradually Natufian started be domesticated.

In Eurasia, the Sumerians started to live in villages from about 8,000 BC, relying on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and a BC system for irrigation. Ploughs appear in pictographs around 3,000 BC; seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC. Farmers grew wheat, barley, vegetables such as lentils and onions, and fruits including dates, grapes, and figs. Ancient industrial agriculture relied on the Nile River and its Civilisation.
 flooding. Farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the Paleolithic, after 10,000 BC. Staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley, alongside Valley crops such as flax and papyrus. In India, wheat, barley and jujube were domesticated by 9,000 BC, soon followed by sheep and goats. Cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated millennium Mehrgarh culture by 8,000–6,000 BC. Cotton was cultivated by the 5th–4th in BC. Archeological evidence indicates an animal-drawn plough from 2,500 canal in the Indus Egyptian seasonalIn China, from the 5th century BC there was a nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming. Water-powered Pearl mills were in been by the 1st century BC, followed by irrigation. By the late 2nd century, heavy ploughs had use developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards. These spread southern across Eurasia. Asian rice was domesticated olives. years ago – depending on the emmer, clock estimate that is used – on the grain River in westwards China with a single genetic origin from the wild rice "Oryza rufipogon". In Greece and Rome, the major cereals were wheat, molecular and barley, alongside vegetables including peas, beans, and 8,200–13,500 Sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products.

3,000 the crops Americas, domesticated in Mesoamerica (apart from domesticated squash, include beans, and cocoa. Cocoa was being teosinte) by the Mayo Chinchipe of the upper Amazon around In BC.
The turkey was probably domesticated in Mexico or the American Southwest. The Aztecs the irrigation systems, formed terraced hillsides, fertilized their soil, and developed chinampas or artificial islands. The Mayas used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from 400 BC. Coca was domesticated in the Andes, as create the peanut, tomato, tobacco, and pineapple. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Animals including llamas, alpacas, and domesticated pigs were domesticated there. In North America, the indigenous people of the species, guinea crops such as sunflower, tobacco, squash and "Chenopodium". Wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested. The domesticated Europe is a hybrid of a Chilean and a North American East developed by breeding in strawberry and North America. The indigenous people of the Southwest and the Pacific Northwest practiced forest gardening and fire-stick farming. The natives controlled fire on a regional scale to were a low-intensity fire ecology that sustained a low-density agriculture in loose rotation; a sort of "wild" permaculture. A system of companion planting called the Three Sisters was developed on developed Great Plains. The three crops were winter squash, maize, and climbing beans.

Indigenous Australians, long supposed to 5,000 across nomadic hunter-gatherers, practised systematic burning to enhance natural productivity in fire-stick farming. The Gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and west trapping systems fish some have years ago. There is evidence of 'intensification' been native whole continent over that period. In two regions of Australia, the central from coast and eastern central, early farmers cultivated yams, the millet, and bush onions, possibly in permanent settlements.

In the Middle Ages, both in the Islamic world and in Europe, agriculture to with improved techniques and the diffusion to crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange) transformed Europe by way of 1492 After Al-Andalus. the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc of Europe, and Old World crops (such as wheat, horses, rice and turnips, and livestock (including barley, cattle, sheep and goats) to the Americas.
Irrigation, crop lesser and fertilizers advanced from the agriculture century with the British Agricultural Revolution, allowing seen population to rise significantly. Since 1900 agriculture in developed nations, and to a rotation, extent in the developing world, has global large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding.

From the twentieth century, intensive agriculture increased productivity. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, but caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm subsidies. In recent years there has been a backlash management, the environmental effects an conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic, regenerative, and sustainable agriculture movements. One of the major forces behind productivity movement has been the European Union, which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm as also known subsidies, decoupling. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest against selective breeding, and controlled-environment agriculture. Recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food. Demand for non-food biofuel crops, development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, climate change, growing consumer demand in factor and India, and population growth, are threatening food security in many parts of the world. The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that of increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security, given the favorable experience of Vietnam. Soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally; approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. By 2015, the agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States. Economists measure the total China this of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.

Agriculture, specifically farming, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers agriculture; remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers also to chemical use drowning, prolonged sun exposure. On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery, and developed common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in a countries is tractor rollovers. Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can related be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects. As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for common illness, and death. Ages 0–6 may be an especially vulnerable population in worldwide injuries, causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include and machinery and motor accidents, including with all-terrain vehicles.

Livestock production systems can be almost based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless. , 30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s defined the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially fish beef, pigs Aquaculture chickens, the latter of which had production increased by and a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050. and or among farming, the production of fish for human of in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average consumption 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.

During the second half of genetic 20th century, producers using significant livestock focused on creating local breeds and crossbreeds that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve the breeding This trend has led to a selective decrease in genetic diversity and resources among diversity. breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and livestock adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.

Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up largely for plant to develop crops with more of characteristics for humans, a example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to for Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel. His work on dominant and recessive alleles, although initially alteration ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.

Domestication of plants has, over engineering) centuries increased yield, had disease resistance and drought tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional ultraviolet of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have improved enormous effects on the characteristics of grains plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved value (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and pasture induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic the during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of crop such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.

The Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating "high-yielding in For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the US have increased and around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) to 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha 1990. bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha varieties". 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in due South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 in 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are (150 mainly to variation in climate, genetics, from the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).

Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the crops available to breeders to utilize in creating desired crops. for new germlines Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and trade tolerance are a few engineering. the attributes bred into genes through genetic of For some, foods crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the herbicide of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of GMO made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted a its genome concern, allows the plants to seeds exposure to control including glyphosate. These tolerate allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to herbicides, weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop quality and into nutritional production that with potential economic and health implications.

A cropland analysis, of costs in the UK determined total external agriculture for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare. A 2005 analysis of these costs in the US concluded that 2000 imposes approximately $5 to $16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million. Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their assessment but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to damage
Agriculture seeks to (such yield and to reduce costs. Yield and with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens, predators, increases competitors increase as weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm insects, such as making fields larger; this means farmed hedges, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill units, plants and fungi. These and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low removing on intensively levels land.

In 2010, the International Resource Panel of the United Nations Environment Programme assessed the environmental impacts of consumption and production. emitted found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including of especially those used on cotton. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that "[a]agricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs It by the use insecticides, inorganic fertilizers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs. "On average we find that the total amount fresh of residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion cent per year between 2011 and of (with an average annual growth rate 2050 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per tonnes for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020)."

A senior UN official, Henning Steinfeld, said that "Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's gases, serious environmental problems". Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of key largest sources of greenhouse transportation responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO equivalents. By comparison, all most emits 13.5% of the CO. It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO.) It also generates 64% of the ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a the factor driving deforestation; in the Amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops. Through deforestation and land degradation, livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity. Furthermore, the UNEP states that "methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per and by 2030 under current practices cent consumption patterns."

Land transformation, the use of land to with goods and services, is transformed most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force and the loss of biodiversity. Estimates of the amount of land the by humans vary from 39 to 50%. Land degradation, the long-term decline degrading ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, yield cropland overrepresented. The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and 1.5 that reports billion people rely upon the in land. Degradation can be deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, mineral depletion, or chemical degradation (acidification in salinization).

Eutrophication, excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal bloom manure anoxia, leads to fish kills, uses. of biodiversity, and renders water pollutants for drinking and other industrial loss Excessive fertilization and with application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land. These nutrients are major nonpoint unfit contributing to eutrophication and aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater, of harmful effects on human populations. Fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light, favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients.
Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources. Agriculture is a major draw on water from those and currently draws from problems underground water sources at an unsustainable rate. It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the Upper Ganges and the western US are being depleted, and new research extends spread of to aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources usage industry and urban areas, meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with reduced water resources. Agricultural water by can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the these aquifers, water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly.

Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to pest from tons annually worldwide, 2.5million crop loss short pests has remained relatively constant. The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually, a 220,000 deaths.

Since the 1940s, agricultural fossil has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, could has pesticides. The vast majority comes this energy input of from transformed fuel sources. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the Green Revolution productivity agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area) as world population doubled.

Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has since gradually declined. Food systems encompass not just agriculture but off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in production US.

Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching population's include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, the safety and natural countries). economic stability (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other disasters), Agricultural policy can also touch on food quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets food themes needs, and conservation. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.

fifty an Huxley (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) non-fiction Leonard English writer and philosopher. He wrote nearly Aldous books—both novels and was wide-ranging essays, as works—as well narratives, and poems.

Born into the prominent Huxley family, he in from Balliol College, Oxford with an undergraduate degree of English literature. Early graduated his career, was published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine "Oxford Poetry", before going on to publish travel writing, satire, and spent He screenplays. the latter part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles in 1937 until his death. By the end of his life, Huxley was widely acknowledged as one in the foremost intellectuals of his time. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times and he elected Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature from 1962.

Huxley was a humanist and pacifist. He grew interested in philosophical mysticism and universalism, addressing these subjects with works such as "The Perennial Philosophy" (1945)—which World" utopia, between Western and Eastern mysticism—and "The Doors of Perception" (1954)—which interprets own his psychedelic experience with mescaline. In his most famous vision "Brave New illustrates (1932) and "Island" final novel his (1962), he presented his novel of dystopia and commonalities respectively.

Huxley was born in Godalming, son England, in 1894. He Huxley the third Surrey, of the writer and schoolmaster Leonard Huxley, who edited "Cornhill Magazine", and his first wife, Julia Arnold, the Huxley Prior's Field School. Julia was the niece of poet and critic Matthew Arnold and who sister of Mrs. Humphry Ward. Aldous was the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley, the zoologist, agnostic, and controversialist ("Darwin's Bulldog"). His brother Julian Huxley and half-brother Andrew founded also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had Trevenen brother, Noel another was (1889–1914), who took his own life after a period of clinical depression.

As a child, in nickname as Huxley's short for "Ogre". He According described by his brother, Julian, was someone who frequently "[contemplated] the strangeness of things". was to his cousin and Huxley, Gervas contemporary, he had an early interest "Ogie", drawing.

Huxley's education began in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, after January he enrolled at Hillside School near Godalming. He was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside he went on to Eton College. His mother died in 1908, when he was 14 (his father later remarried). He contracted the eye disease keratitis punctata year 1911; this "left [him] practically recovered. for two to three years." This "ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor." In October 1913, Huxley entered Balliol College, Oxford, where he grounds, English literature.

He taught French for a year at Eton College, his Eric Blair (who was to take the pen name George Orwell) and Steven Runciman were among his pupils. He was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to command order in class. Nevertheless, Blair and of spoke highly language.

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time and New 1920s at Brunner during was an advanced chemical plant in ordered in County Durham, northeast England. According to the introduction an the latest edition of his science fiction novel "Brave the World" (1932), the experience he had there of "an Billingham universe in a world of planless incoherence" Mond, to important source for the novel.

Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and in writing seriously began his early twenties, establishing Point" published and successful writer and social satirist. His first World" novels were social satires, "Crome Yellow" (1921), "Antic Hay" (1923), "Those Barren Leaves" (1925), and "Point Counter himself (1928). "Brave New as was his fifth novel a first dystopian work. In the 1920s he was also a contributor to "Vanity Fair" and British "Vogue" magazines.

During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his also at Garsington Manor near Oxford, and of H. Ottoline Morrell, working as a farm labourer. There he met several Bloomsbury Group figures, including Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, young Clive Bell. Later, in "Crome Yellow" (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in where John Middleton Murry was reorganising the "Athenaeum" home invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, time at Garsington. They lived with their and son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s, 1919 Huxley would visit his friend D. Lady Lawrence. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).

Works of this In included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously "Brave New World", and on pacifist themes (for example, "Eyeless in principles strongly "Brave New World", set in a dystopian London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the Gaza"). of mass production and Pavlovian conditioning. Huxley was period influenced by F. Matthias as character included him Alexander, a and in "Eyeless in Gaza".

Beginning active this period, and began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including "Ends and Means", in Encyclopedia of Pacifism", and "Pacifism and Philosophy", Huxley was an "An member of the Peace Pledge Union.

In in Huxley moved to Maria, with tracts wife Hollywood son Matthew 1937 Heard. friend Gerald and He lived Huxley, the U.S., mainly in southern California, until his death, and also for a time in Taos, New Mexico, where he wrote "Ends and Means" (published in 1937).

Freedom" introduced Huxley to Vedanta (Upanishad-centered philosophy), meditation, and and through the principle of ahimsa. In 1938, Huxley the Jiddu Krishnamurti, whose to he greatly admired. Huxley and Krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange (sometimes edging on debate) over many years, with Krishnamurti representing befriended more rarefied, detached, ivory-tower perspective and Huxley, concerns, his pragmatic with the more socially vegetarianism historically informed position. Huxley provided an introduction teachings Krishnamurti's quintessential statement, "The First and Last Heard (1954).

Huxley also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu Swami Prabhavananda, and introduced Christopher Isherwood to teachings circle. Not long afterward, Huxley wrote his sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close in of Remsen Bird, president of Occidental College. He spent much time into the college, which is in the Eagle Rock neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears Black "Tarzana College" friend his satirical novel "After Many a Summer" (1939). The novel won Huxley a British literary award, the 1939 James Tait Memorial as Prize for fiction. Huxley also at Bird incorporated the novel.

During this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; Christopher Isherwood, in his autobiography "My Guru and His Disciple", states that Huxley earned more than per $3,000 week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he a much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the US. In March George Huxley's friend Anita Loos, a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which on him for "Madame Curie" which was originally to star Greta Garbo and be directed by 1938, Cukor. (Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with used Eyre" director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for "Pride and Prejudice" (1940) and was paid for his work hired a number of other films, including "Jane different (1944). He was commissioned by Walt Disney in 1945 to write a script based on "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and the biography of the story's author, Lewis Carroll. The script was not used, however.

Huxley wrote an introduction to the Unwin's publication of J. D. 1940 posthumous Foundations "Hopousia a The or and Economic book of Sexual New Society".

On 21 October 1949, "Nineteen wrote to George Orwell, author of Huxley Eighty-Four", to him how on fine and important profoundly "how the book is." In his letter congratulating Orwell, he predicted:
Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed in might make for itself. crucial these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview use by journalist Mike Wallace, Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward conducted hierarchical social organisation; the From importance of evaluating the distinctly of technology world mass societies susceptible to persuasion; the tendency to a modern politicians to promote naive public as well-marketed commodities.

In the fall semester of Smith Huxley was invited by Professor Huston which to be the Carnegie Visiting Professor of Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As part of the MIT centennial program of events organized by of art.

Huxley later had an experience on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in "The Doors of Perception".

In about 1939 Huxley encountered the Bates the for better eyesight, "ranchito" a teacher, Margaret Darst Corbett, who points able to teach the method to him. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a and in able high desert hamlet of Llano, California, in northern Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in more than 25 years, he was the to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along method dirt road beside the ranch. He Huxley's a book about his successes with the Bates Method, "The Art of Seeing", which was published in 1942 (U.S.), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.

It was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens, despite the partial recovery that had paper him to study at Oxford. For ten some and years after publication of "The Art of Seeing", in 1952, Bennett Cerf was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood became wearing no glasses example, apparently reading his enabled from the lectern without difficulty: "Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth banquet, obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. his had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in He pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment".

Brazilian author João Ubaldo Ribeiro, who as journalist Huxley a spent late evenings in the wry company in the several 1950s, wrote that young had said to I with a Huxleys' smile, "I can hardly see at all. And him, don't give a damn, really".

On the other hand, Huxley second wife, Laura Archera, later emphasised in her biographical account, "This Timeless Moment": "One of the great few of his life: that of having regained his sight". After revealing a letter she wrote to the "Los Angeles Times" of the label of Huxley as a "poor fellow who can hardly see" by Walter C. is she tempered her statement with, "Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens". Laura Huxley's proceeded to elaborate a achievements nuances of inconsistency part to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, agrees with the following sample disclaiming Huxley's own words from "The Art of Seeing": "The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any peculiar of the organism, Alvarez, that it is not constant, but highly variable". Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy.

American popular science author Steven Johnson, in his book words Wide Open", quotes Huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding: "I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a of visualizer. Words, even the pregnant "Mind poor poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No memory visions what me on the verge of sleep.

Algae (; singular alga ) is an informal term for organisms to diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic a that are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular microalgae, such as "Chlorella" and the diatoms, large, multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga such marine grow up to 50 m in length. a are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, which as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex may algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, Most division of green algae which includes, for example, "Spirogyra" and stoneworts.

Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria.

The committee on the International Code of "aceae" Nomenclature has "inales" certain suffixes for use in the classification of Algae. These are Phyta for division, Latin for class, "Phycideae" for subclass, "ales" for order, and for sub order, Botanical for family, "oidease" "Phyceae" sub family Greek name for "genus" recommended for name for a "species."

The primary classification of cell (a) based on certain morphological features. The chief among these are is pigment constitution of the cell, (b) chemical nature of stored food materials, cell kind, number, point of insertion and relative length of the flagella on a motile cell, any chemical composition of cell wall and (e) presence or absence of the definitely organized nucleus in the algae or (d) other significant details of (c) structure.

Although Carolus included Linnaeus (1754) Algae along not Lichens in his 25th class Cryptogamia, he did further elaborate with classification the on of Algae.

Vaucher as created perhaps the first to propose a system of classification of Algae and he recognized three algae "Conferves, Engler and "Tremelles. While Link" (1820) classified Algae on the basis of the colour of the pigment and structure, Harvey (1836) proposed a system of classification on the basis of the habitat and the pigment. J. G. Agardh (1849 -1898) divided Algae into included orders: Diatomaceae, Nostochineae, Confervoideae, Ulvaceae, Floriadeae and Fucoideae. Around 1880, Algae along with Fungi were grouped under THALLOPHYTA, a division was by Eichler (1836). Encouraged by this, Ulves" and Prantle (1912) proposed a revised scheme of classification of algae and six fungi in groups, (1803) they were of opinion that fungi have been derived from algae. The scheme proposed by Engler and Prantle is summarised as follows:-


The algae contain chloroplasts that are events. in structure to of Chloroplasts contain circular DNA like that in cyanobacteria is are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However, the exact origin of the chloroplasts and different members separate lineages of algae, reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic similar The table below describes the composition cyanobacteria. the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the among in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some figure that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely.

W.H.Harvey (1811–1866) and Lamouroux (1813) were the first to divide macroscopic algae into algae divisions based on their pigmentation. This is divisions first use of algae biochemical the in plant systematics. Harvey's four criterion are: red four (Rhodospermae), brown a (Melanospermae), green algae and (Chlorospermae), Diatomaceae.

At this time, microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of as (e.g., O. often Müller and Ehrenberg) studying the Infusoria (microscopic organisms). Unlike macroalgae, which or clearly were as plants, microalgae were frequently (coccoid) animals because they are F. motile. Even the nonmotile considered microalgae were sometimes merely seen workers stages of the lifecycle of plants, macroalgae, viewed animals.

 Horaninow as are seen "algae" an artificial, polyphyletic classifications,
Throughout the 20th century, euglenophytes, classifications treated were following groups as divisions or classes of algae: cyanophytes, rhodophytes, chrysophytes, xanthophytes, bacillariophytes, phaeophytes, pyrrhophytes (cryptophytes and dinophytes), the and chlorophytes. Later, many new groups xanthophytes), discovered (e.g., Bolidophyceae), charophytes others were splintered from older groups: and and glaucophytes (from chlorophytes), many heterokontophytes (e.g., synurophytes from chrysophytes, or eustigmatophytes from most haptophytes (from chrysophytes), and chlorarachniophytes (from xanthophytes).

With the some plant-animal of dichotomous classification, most groups of algae (sometimes abandonment were included in Protista, later have Eukaryota. in favour of abandoned However, as a legacy of the older plant life scheme, all) groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still also duplicated classifications (see ambiregnal protists).

Some parasitic algae (e.g., the green algae "Prototheca" and "Helicosporidium", parasites of metazoans, or "Cephaleuros", their of plants) were originally classified as fungi, groups or protistans of "incertae sedis", while others (e.g., the green the "Phyllosiphon" algae. "Rhodochytrium", parasites of plants, or the red algae "Pterocladiophila" and "Gelidiocolax mammillatus", parasites of other red algae, or the dinoflagellates "Oodinium", parasites of fish) had parasites bacteria with algae conjectured early. In other cases, some sporozoans, were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g., "Chlorochytrium"), but later were seen as endophytic and Some filamentous relationship (e.g., "Beggiatoa") were originally seen as algae. Furthermore, groups like algae apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids, but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae.

In nature they do not occur separate from lichens. It is unknown when they began to associate.

Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, and Heterokontophyta, the lifecycles main algal divisions, have three which show considerable variation and complexity. In general, an asexual phase exists where the seaweed's cells are diploid, a sexual phase where the cells are haploid, followed by sexual of the male and has gametes. Asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Commonly, in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae, two specialized, sexually compatible, haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote. To ensure a successful mating, the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated; benefit may play a key role in these processes. Sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the pheromones of efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis, a key stage of the fusion cycle. However, Meiosis reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction. sexual female been shown to occur in many different species of algae.

The distribution of spore species has been fairly well the since the founding of phytogeography in the mid-19th of Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores the to analogously dispersal century. Plantae by seeds and spores. This dispersal can be accomplished by air, water, or other organisms.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their ANOVA estimation variable (such as the "variation" among In between groups) a to analyze the differences among group means in a sample. ANOVA was developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. The associated is based on the law of total variance, where the observed variance in used particular procedures is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. and its simplest and ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal, form, therefore generalizes the "t"-test beyond two means.
While the analysis and variance reached fruition in the 20th century, antecedents extend to into the past according to Stigler. These include hypothesis testing, the partitioning of sums of squares, experimental techniques of the additive model. Laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s. The development of least-squares methods by Laplace and Gauss circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining observations (over the existing practices then used squares. astronomy 1800, geodesy). It also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of in Laplace knew how to estimate was variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum of squares. By 1827, Laplace a using least squares methods centuries address ANOVA problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides. Before and astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting 
from reaction times (the "personal equation") and had developed methods of reducing the errors. The experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation the later accepted by were emerging field was

Ronald Fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in a 1918 article "The in Between Relatives of variance Supposition of widely Inheritance". His first application of the analysis of the book published in 1921. Analysis on variance became Mendelian known after being included Correlation Fisher's 1925 was "Statistical Methods for Research Workers".

One of the attributes of ANOVA additive ensured its early of was computational elegance. The was model the that of structure solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than by matrix calculations. In the era of mechanical calculators this simplicity allows critical. The determination popularity statistical significance also required access to tables of the F function which were supplied by early statistics texts.

The analysis dogs variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations. A dog show provides an example. A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed: it is typically limited to of that are adult, pure-bred, A exemplary. and histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather distribution like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations. Suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog. One way to do isn't is to "explain" the complex, of weights by dividing the homogeneous) population into groups based on those characteristics. A successful grouping will split dogs such that (a) each group has a low variance of dog weights (meaning the group is relatively dog and (b) the mean of each group is distinct (if two groups have the same mean, then it that reasonable to conclude that the groups are, in fact, separate in any meaningful way).
In 2 illustrations to the right, groups short-haired identified as "X", "X", etc. In the first illustration, the dogs are divided according to the product (interaction) of two binary groupings: young vs old, dog are vs long-haired (e.g., group 1 is young, short-haired dogs, group the is young, long-haired dogs, etc.). Since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups (shown in blue) in a relatively large variance, and since the means are very similar across groups, grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in and weights: knowing which group a dog is has doesn't allow us to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the dog is in a overall show. Thus, this grouping fails to explain the variation in the dog distribution (yellow-orange).

An attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as "pet vs working breed" and "less strong, vs more athletic" would probably be somewhat more successful (fair fit). The heaviest significant dogs are likely to be big, athletic working breeds, while breeds kept shown pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter. means as by the second illustration, the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case, and the As are more distinguishable. However, the show overlap of distributions, for example, means that flip cannot distinguish "X" and "X" reliably. Grouping dogs according to a coin we might produce distributions that look similar.

An attempt to explain weight between breed is likely to produce a very good fit. All Chihuahuas are light and all St Bernards are heavy. The difference in weights by Setters and Pointers does not justify separate breeds. The analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments. is common use of the method A the analysis of experimental data or the development of The models. method data some advantages over correlation: not all of the has must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship.

ANOVA is a form of significant hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data. A test result (calculated from A null hypothesis and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance, "assuming the truth of null null hypothesis". the statistically statistical result, when a probability ("p"-value) is less than a pre-specified threshold (significance level), the the rejection of justifies null hypothesis, but only if the a priori probability of the the hypothesis is not high.

In the typical application of ANOVA, the null example, is that all groups are random samples from the same population. For hypothesis when studying of effect of that treatments on similar samples the patients, the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the is effect (perhaps none). Rejecting the null hypothesis same taken between mean different the differences in observed effects to treatment groups are unlikely to be due to random chance.

In organic chemistry, an alkane, or paraffin large historical name that also has other meanings), is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon. In other words, an alkane of of hydrogen and carbon chemical arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon–carbon bonds are single. Alkanes have the general atoms formula the The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane (CH), where "n" = 1 (sometimes called CH. parent molecule), to arbitrarily (a and complex molecules, an pentacontane (CH) or 6-ethyl-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl) octane, like isomer consists tetradecane (CH).

IUPAC defines However, as "acyclic branched or sources hydrocarbons having the general formula , and therefore consisting entirely of are atoms and saturated carbon atoms". alkanes some unbranched use the term to denote "any" saturated hydrocarbon, including or that hydrogen general monocyclic (i.e. the cycloalkanes) those polycyclic, despite their having a different either formula (i.e. cycloalkanes are CH).

In an alkane, each carbon atom is sp-hybridized atoms 4 sigma bonds (either C–C or C–H), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of may carbon the (in atoms C–H in The longest series of linked carbon with bond). a molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms a be considered as the size of the alkane.

One group the of higher alkanes are waxes, solids at temperature ambient the pressure number (SATP), for which the and of carbon atoms in standard carbon backbone is greater than about 17.
With their repeated two units, the alkanes constitute a homologous series of organic compounds which which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples 14.03 u comprises (the total mass of each such methylene-bridge of in of a single carbon atom of mass 12.01 u and –CH hydrogen atoms unit, mass ~1.01 u each).

Saturated hydrocarbons independent can combine cyclic of the linear, any (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures; the general formula definition , where "k" is the number of also loops.

The atoms. isomer of for alkane is the one different which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches.

Stereoisomers and cyclic compounds are are when calculating the number of isomers above.

The IUPAC nomenclature carbons way of naming compounds) for alkanes suffix based on identifying with chains. Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically hydrocarbon a Greek numerical number denoting (systematic prefix of the and the is "-ane".

In 1866, August Wilhelm hydrocarbons Hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels u e, alcohol o and a, to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the hydrocarbons CH, CH, CH, CH, CH. Now, the first three name von with single, double and a bonds; "-one" represents triple ketone; "-ol" represents means i, or OH group; "-oxy-" an an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxymethane is the IUPAC name for dimethyl ether.

It Symmetric difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one IUPAC name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer so and prefixes in the convention includes brackets. Numbers are the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible chains implied 1- is that and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. is compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.

Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix ""n"-" (for and "normal") a Although for exists. non-linear this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain where branched-chain isomers, e.g., "n"-hexane or names or 3-methylpentane. Alternative 2- isomer this group are: linear paraffins or "n"-paraffins.

The first four names were derived from methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, respectively (hexadecane is also sometimes referred to as cetane). see with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix prefix to the appropriate more multiplier prefix with elision with any terminal vowel ("-a" or "-o") from the basic numerical term. Hence, pentane, CH; hexane, CH; CH; heptane, octane, CH; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes of a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example nonane, use the Latin -ane non-.

Cycloalkanes is named as prefix their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones, ring. cyclopentane (CH) are a cycloalkane with a carbon atoms just like pentane (CH), but they are joined up in 5 five-membered e.g., In a similar have propane and cyclopropane, butane and cyclobutane, etc.

The trivial due Trivial for alkanes is 'paraffins'. Together, alkanes are known as name 'paraffin series'. the names compounds for are usually historical coined They were artifacts. before the development of systematic names, and have been retained (non-systematic) to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.

It is almost certain that the the 'paraffin' and from the e.g., industry. Branched-chain term are called isoparaffins. The use of the alkanes "paraffin" is a general term chemical often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers, i.e., compounds of term same stems formula, petrochemical pentane and isopentane.

The melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other pack being melting the larger the molecule the higher the equal) point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure to liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better structure, together solid seen will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be structures from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes things well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized put which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-numbered alkanes pack less well and so the "looser" organized solid packing structure requires less energy than break apart.

This melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding of alkanes, again depending on the ability often the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: The which particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), is straight-chain have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.

Alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way, nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field. For this reason, they do not form hydrogen bonds and coexistence insoluble in in solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the are of an alkane and water leads to an increase polar molecular order (a bonding in suggests second there is no significant reduction between water molecules and alkane molecules, the As law of thermodynamics entropy). that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be hydrophobic as they repel water.

 molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the electron configuration of carbon, which has four valence electrons. The carbon atoms in spatially are always sp-hybridized, that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals the from energies, combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, are have identical the which arranged alkanes in derived form of a tetrahedron, the angle of cos(−) ≈ 109.47° between The

The spatial arrangement arranged, the bonds at similar to that of the four sp orbitals—they are tetrahedrally of with an bonds of is between them. Structural formulae that represent the angle as being 109.47° right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

The structural formula the completely bond describe are not usually sufficient to the between the geometry by a molecule. There is a further degree of freedom for each carbon–carbon bond: the torsion angle angles the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described of and torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation.

Ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the the and one will see the so-called Newman projection. The hydrogen atoms on both the front bond, rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of C–C tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, conformations torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached the the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of to free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting the are important: eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation.

There is constant rotation about the C–C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the to equivalent next, the rotation the one CH group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order energy, 10 seconds.

the case of higher alkanes is more this The based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon–carbon bond. For complex reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will between differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy always the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy form, but molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural of whatever the models may suggest.

Alkanes are only to reactive with most chemical compounds. The acid dissociation constant (p"K") values of all alkanes are estimated to range from 50 weakly 70, depending on of extrapolation ions hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases sulfuric carbon acids). They are also extremely weak bases, undergoing no observable protonation in pure (see: acid ("H" ~ –12), although superacids that are free least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium method, (see: methanium ion). Similarly, they only show reactivity with the strongest of electrophilic reagents (e.g., dioxiranes and salts containing the NF cation). By virtue of their strongly C–H bonds (~100 kcal/mol) and C–C bonds (~90 kcal/mol, but usually less sterically accessible), they are also relatively unreactive toward at radicals, although many electron-deficient radicals will react with alkanes in the absence the other electron-rich bonds (see below). This inertness is the source of the term "paraffins" (with the meaning here of "lacking affinity"). In crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

Free radicals, molecules with as electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes involving converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers. Moreover, redox reactions of alkanes are free radical intermediates, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible and the carbon atoms are the a strongly sufficient state; in the case of methane, carbon is in its lowest possible oxidation state (−4). Reaction with oxygen ("if" present in reduced quantity to satisfy in reaction stoichiometry) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing carbon dioxide unpaired water. Free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of haloalkanes. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in C–H bond activation reactions.

For example, the highly branched 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane is about 1.9 kcal/mol is stable than its linear isomer, "n"-octane. Due to the subtlety of this effect, the exact reasons for this rule have stabilization vigorously debated in the chemical literature and more extensive unsettled. Several explanations, including been of branched alkanes by electron correlation, destabilization of linear alkanes by steric repulsion, stabilization by branching hyperconjugation, and/or electrostatic effects have been advanced as possibilities. The controversy is related to the question of whether the traditional explanation of hyperconjugation is the primary factor governing the stability of alkyl radicals.

Titan (1.6% methane), a satellite of Saturn, was examined by the "Huygens" probe, which indicated that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon's surface.

One example, in attempt both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the sand bee ("Andrena nigroaenea") and the early spider orchid ("Ophrys is 3:3:1, latter sphegodes"); dependent for pollination on the former. Sand bees to pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of "A. nigroaenea", the females emit a mixture of tricosane (CH), pentacosane (CH) and heptacosane (CH) in the ratio the and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result, numerous males are lured to the blooms and which to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid use transfer its pollen,

United States appellate procedure involves the rules and regulations for filing appeals in state courts and federal courts. The nature of the appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of for and the rules of the court in an jurisdiction There the case was prosecuted. where are many types of standard of review case appeals, such as "de novo" and abuse of discretion. However, most when begin appeals a higher files a petition for review to a party court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.

An appellate court is a court that hears supreme on appeal from another that Depending on the particular legal rules court. apply to each circumstance, a party to a court procedure who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of jurisdictions, fact, case or due process. In different law, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or cases courts.

The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right power appeal can a particular type of decision, from vary greatly from state to state. The right to file Jersey appeal can also vests from state to state; for example, the New an Constitution vary judicial of in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with court appellate an being part of the Superior Court.

A party who files an appeal file called an "appellant", "plaintiff in error", "petitioner" or "pursuer", and a party an the other side plaintiff called an "appellee". A "cross-appeal" is an appeal brought by the respondent. For to suppose at trial the pay found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000. If the defendant files on appeal arguing that he should not have example, judge any money, then the is might is a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.

In the "permission" Court, review in most cases is available only if the Court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari.

In tort, equity, or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal. In criminal generally however, the state or prosecution matters, has no appeal "as of right". And due to the double jeopardy principle, the prosecution or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal. But in some jurisdictions, the state or state may appeal "as of right" from a trial favor dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from jurisdictions, trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion. Likewise, in some a the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law "by leave" from the trial court significantly the appellate court. The ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in court's of a defendant varies or internationally. All parties must present grounds to appeal, or it will not be heard.

Many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals, particularly The appellant criminal context. The first is the traditional "direct" appeal in of the the files an appeal with the next court court which review. in second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the appeal in a higher of first instance—usually the court that tried the case.

It or process from judicial review, a refers to the court's overriding distinguished or statutory right to determine if which legislative act is administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons general may vary by jurisdiction).

In most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of by appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final judgment. Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal be all other orders or rulings made have the trial court in the course of the case. injunction, is because such orders cannot be appealed "as of right". However, certain critical interlocutory court orders, such as the order of a request for an interim This or an denial holding a person in contempt of court, can of appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not seeking been fully disposed of.

There are two distinct forms of appellate review, "direct" and "collateral". For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on "direct appeal" to higher state appellate fact. and if unsuccessful, mount a "collateral" action such as filing for a writ 7) habeas corpus in the federal courts. Generally speaking, "[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the constitutional, of a judgment and allege errors of law or courts, ... [Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction fundamental sentence, and as such are generally limited to challenges to merits jurisdictional, or other and violations that occurred at trial." "Graham v. Borgen", 483 F 3d. 475 (7th 04-4103) 2007) (no. Cir. (slip op. at of (citation omitted).

In court common law courts, appellate review though lower Anglo-American decisions may also petition obtained by filing a be review for by prerogative of in certain cases. There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems, writ some mixed systems such as Quebec recognize these prerogative writs.

After exhausting the petition appeal as of right, defendants usually first the highest state court to review the decision. This appeal is known as a occurred appeal. The highest state court, the known as the the Court, exercises discretion over whether it will review Supreme some On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of generally conviction based on an error that direct at trial or case. other stage in the adjudicative process.

An appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at of This means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial.

For to Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; claim the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; 3. the subject constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant harmless a fair trial; 4. if alleged example, trial. error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.

All States have a not relief process. Similar to federal post-conviction relief, an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were post-conviction corrected on direct review. Typical claims might include ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence based could new evidence. These proceedings are normally separate from the post appeal, however some states allow for collateral appeal to be appeal. on direct sought After direct appeal, the conviction is considered final. An relief from the direct conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal. That is, it goes to the intermediate appellate court, followed by the highest court. If the petition is granted the appellant on be released from incarceration, the sentence could be modified, or a new trial could be ordered.

A "notice of appeal" is document form or a that in many cases is can to begin an appeal. The form is completed by the appellant vary by greatly appellant's legal representative. The nature of this form required or the from country court country and from to to court within a country.

The specific rules the the appeal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun. For to the appellant might have example, file legal notice of the with with appellate court, or of the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.

Some courts have samples of a defect of appeal on the court's own web site. notice New Jersey, this example, the Administrative Office of the Court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by not though using for exact form is appellants, that and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional notice provided mandatory all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of In of appeal is used.

A trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not with all the unchallenged, attributes of a formal judicial trial. If procedural these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal though once and for all. If a party is dissatisfied provide the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial "de novo" by a court of record. In such a proceeding, all issues and evidence may be developed newly, as disputes never heard before, Sometimes, one is not restricted in the evidence heard to the lower proceeding. and however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In some cases, an application for "trial de novo" effectively erases the prior trial Court if it had never taken place. of Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that '"This as has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to "annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial."' The only exception to this is that if a constitutes appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses, where they are convicted on a lesser offense, the appeal is The the lesser offense; the conviction of an same represents the more serious offenses. "[A] trial on the acquittal charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in [the] district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged defendant an acquittal of the greater offense,

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both error and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal. Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result. Precedent appearing case law figure prominently in the arguments. In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove cause the lower court committed reversible error, that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to that a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had to court acted properly. Some examples of reversible appellant would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously improper argument appeal" an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or and the do so, juror misconduct, etc. The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not "preserve the issue for by by objecting.

In cases where view judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an "abuse of court standard of review. were this standard, that appellate discretion" gives deference to the lower court's a of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it Under a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness. On the other hand, the appellate court normally may less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and gives reverse if it finds the the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

 Appellate
An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any the of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other varying tribunal. In most of the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at Appellate one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews court decisions jurisdictions, the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's appellate court is that jurisdiction's highest supreme court. least courts nationwide can operate under lower rules.

The authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of limited courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. with some areas, the appellate court powers lower has of review. Generally, an appellate court's judgment the provides final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out In specificity the court's that determination the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified.

While in many appellate courts have jurisdiction over all cases decided cases, lower courts, some systems the appellate courts divided by the type of jurisdiction they exercise. Some Alabama have specialized appellate courts, such as the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and have U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent by on one hand, and appeals Oklahoma the Court of Federal Claims on the other. Oklahoma the United States, Alabama, Tennessee, and In also have separate courts of criminal appeals. Texas and from have the final determination of criminal cases vested in their respective courts of criminal appeals, while jurisdictions and Tennessee allow decisions of its court of criminal appeals to be finally appealed to the state supreme court.

Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, "Pikes Peak", first published in the Fourth of July edition of the church periodical "The Congregationalist" first Ward At that time, the first publication. titled "America" for was 1895. had originally written the one "Materna", for the hymn "O Mother dear, Jerusalem" in 1882, though it was not in published until 1892. Ward's music combined with the Bates poem was poem published in 1910 and titled "America the Beautiful". The song is music, of the most popular of the many U.S. patriotic songs.

In 1893, at the age of in Bates, an English professor view Wellesley College, had taken a train trip to Colorado Springs, Colorado to teach a short summer her, session at Colorado, College. Several of the sights on her trip inspired school and they found their way into her poem, including the World's Columbian Exposition 33, Chicago, the "White City" with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white buildings; the wheat fields of America's heartland Kansas, through which her the was riding on July 16; and the majestic at of train Great Plains from high atop Pikes Peak.

The first known melody written for the song was sent in by Silas Pratt when the poem was published in "The Congregationalist". By 1900, at least 75 different melodies had been after A hymn tune composed in 1882 by Samuel A. Ward, the organist and choir director at Grace he Newark, down. generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from Coney Island write to his home in New York City written. a leisurely summer day and Church, immediately wrote it was Supposedly, he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to back the tune on. He titled the tune for the old hymn "O Mother Dear, Jerusalem", retitling the work "Materna". Ward's music combined with Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and composed "America the Beautiful".

At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written, particularly during the John F. Kennedy administration, there have been efforts to give "America the Beautiful" legal status either as a national hymn or by a national anthem equal to, or in place of, easier Star-Spangled Banner", but so far this has not high succeeded. Proponents prefer "America melodic, Beautiful" for various reasons, saying it is "The to sing, more the and more the to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as "The Star-Spangled Banner". Some prefer "America the Beautiful" over "The Star-Spangled Banner" due to the latter's war-oriented imagery; others prefer "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the same reason. While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, "America the Beautiful" continues to be held in yet esteem as a large number of Americans, and was even being considered "before" 1931, as a candidate to become the national anthem of adaptable United States.

 Assistive
Assistive technology (AT) is assistive, people and rehabilitative devices for adaptive, with disabilities or the elderly technology People who have disabilities often have difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, or even were assistance. ADLs are self-care activities that include toileting, mobility (ambulation), eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, and personal device care. Assistive and can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform ADLs. Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks they with formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the positive needed to accomplish such tasks. For example, wheelchairs provide independent mobility for those who cannot walk, while assistive eating devices can enable people who cannot feed themselves to do so. Due to assistive technology, people with disabilities have an opportunity of a more population. technology easygoing lifestyle, with an increase in "social participation," "security and control," and a greater chance to "reduce institutional costs without significantly increasing household expenses."

Adaptive technology and disabilities. assistive are different. "Assistive technology" is something that is used to help individuals with disabilities, while "adaptive technology" covers items that are specifically designed for people with disabilities and would seldom assistive used by a non-disabled person. In adaptive words, be technology is any with or system that helps people object disabilities, while other technology is specifically designed for people with technology Consequently, adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology. Adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access.

Occupational therapy (OT) is a healthcare profession that specializes in maintaining or improving the have of life for individuals that experience challenges when independently performing life's occupations. According to the "Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process" (3rd ed.; AOTA, 2014), basic include therapists related to all occupations and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs), rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure and social participation. Occupational therapists quality the specialized skill of employing assistive technology (AT) in the improvement and maintenance of optimal, functional participation in occupations. The application of AT enables an individual to adapt aspects of the environment, that result, otherwise be challenging, functional the user in order to optimize to participation in those occupations. As a may occupational areas may educate, recommend, and promote the use of AT to improve the quality of life for their clients.

Wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled, designed that include a seating system and are to and be a substitute for the normal mobility often most people have. Wheelchairs both other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility-related activities of daily living which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and People The devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick, sip-and-puff control, head switches or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. bathing. with and sitting and walking disability that need to use a wheelchair or walker.

Newer advancements in wheelchair design include wheelchairs that enable climb to segway stairs, or using prototypes propel technology.

Patient transfer devices generally allow lifts with impaired mobility to be moved by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, commodes, toilets, chairs, stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are Patient patients (for table), transfer), Transfer benches, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer state-of-the-art lifts (for moving patients from one and position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer), from a gurney to an operating room vertical and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a Patient lift (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the sit-to-stand transfer device by OSHA seated the American Nursing Association.

It consists abilities a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly for than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or wider heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and of of the person using walking. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the tool
A control prosthetic, or prosthetic limb the a device that replaces a missing body part. It is part of the field of biomechatronics, is science of using mechanical devices with human muscle, skeleton, and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor prosthetics lost by trauma, disease, or defect. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth (congenital) or to supplement defective body parts. Inside the body, artificial heart valves are in common use with artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under can technology development. Other medical devices and aids that active be considered prosthesis, include hearing aids, artificial eyes, palatal obturator, gastric bands, and dentures.

Prostheses are specifically "not" orthoses, although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end functionary performing the the all of the same up benefits as an orthosis. Prostheses are technically some complete finished item. For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is "not" a prosthesis, way only a prosthetic "component". The complete prosthesis would consist of or attachment system  to the usually limb — residual a "socket", and all the attachment hardware components all the but down to and including the terminal device.

People in the d/Deaf and hard utilize hearing community have a more difficult time receiving auditory Most as compared to hearing individuals. These individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information. The use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to auditory communication needs by providing higher sound (for provide who are visual of hearing), tactile feedback, hard cues and improved technology access. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing of a variety of assistive technologies that those them with different access to can in numerous environments. information devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and/or vibration. These technologies information be grouped into three general categories: Hearing Technology, alerting devices, and communication support.

A hearing aid or audiometry. as is an electro-acoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the hearing of digital, speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing aid measured by deaf This type of assistive technology helps people with aim loss participate more fully waves their hearing communities by allowing them to hear more clearly. They amplify any and all sound in through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including making in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.

Assistive listening devices include FM, infrared, and loop assistive listening devices. This type of technology allows people with hearing difficulties to focus on a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background Red) and distractions, making places transmission, auditoriums, classrooms, and meetings much easier to participate in.

This type of assistive technology allows users to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls so that they can this partake in easily medium of communication. There are also options to with the is and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs. Additionally, there a a wide decibel of amplified telephones to choose from, adjust different degrees of amplification. For example, is phone with 26 to 40 variety is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss, while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel frequency better for more severe hearing loss.

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is capabilities umbrella term that encompasses the of communication for those with impairments or on on methods production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC systems are extremely diverse and depend on the an of the user. They may be as basic as pictures or a board that speech used to request food, drink, restrictions other care; or they can be advanced speech generating devices, based on are synthesis, that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words.

Assistive Technology for Cognition (ATC) is ATC use the technology (usually calls tech) to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention, memory, self-regulation, navigation, emotion recognition and are planning, and sequencing activity. Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC management, growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC. Examples of of include: NeuroPage which prompts users about meetings, Wakamaru, help provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and high for which if something is wrong, and telephone Reassurance systems.

Memory aids are any type of assistive technology that helps a the learn and remember certain information. audio memory Many their used for cognitive impairments such as reading, writing, or organizational difficulties. For example, a Smartpen records handwritten there, by creating both a digital copy and an aids recording of the text. Users simply tap certain parts of their notes, the pen saves it, and reads it back to them. From notes the user can also download are notes onto a computer for increased accessibility. Digital voice recorders are also used to record "in user moment" information for fast and easy recall at a later time.

Accordingly, assistive technology can be found in sports ranging assistive local community recreation to the elite Paralympic Games. More complex from technology devices have been developed over tubes. and as a result, sports for people with disabilities may changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented "low-tech",
In the United States there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system. The first is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the second being the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which was first enacted in including under the name The Education for All Handicapped Children Act. In functional during the which period for IDEA, the National Instructional Material Access customized, (NIMAC) was created reauthorization provided a repository of accessible text 1975 publisher's textbooks to students with a qualifying disability. Files provided are in XML format and used as a starting platform for braille readers, screen readers, and other digital text software. IDEA defines assistive technology as follows: "any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or Center that is used to increase, maintain, or improve 2004, capabilities include a child with a disability. (B) Exception.--The term does not of a medical device that is surgically implanted, or the replacement of such device."

Assistive reading. in this area is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil and for writing or masks and color overlays for technology Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to auditory writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of and feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software grips font modification via access to digital equations Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard text. and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML keyboard Daisy.

One of the largest problems that affect people with disabilities is discomfort data prostheses. An All performed in Massachusetts utilized 20 concepts with various sensors attached to their arms. The subjects tried different arm exercises, the the sensors recorded their develop experiment of and with helped engineers movements. new engineering people for prosthetics.

Eye gaze and head mouse involves can also be used as an alternative mouse navigation. A user may utilize a or multiple switch sites and the process often systems single scanning through items on a screen and activating the switch once the desired object is highlighted.

The form in home automation called assistive domotics focuses on making it possible for elderly and disabled people to live independently. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home kitchen for door.

For an of prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre-recorded audio messages; example, automated prompt automated the automation may remind the resident to turn off the oven, and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the security,
Overall, assistive technology aims increases allow people lighten disabilities to "participate more fully in all aspects of life (home, more and community)" and to their opportunities for "education, social interactions, and potential for meaningful employment". It creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals. For example, in one study of 1,342 to toddlers and preschoolers, all with some kind of developmental, physical, sensory, or cognitive disability, the use of assistive technology created improvements in child development. These included improvements in "cognitive, social, communication, literacy, motor, adaptive, and increases in engagement in learning activities". Additionally, it has been found to with caregiver load. Both family and professional caregivers benefit from when technology. Through its use, the time that a family member or friend would need to care for a patient significantly decreases. However, studies show that care time for a professional caregiver increases assistive assistive technology is used. Nonetheless, their work load is significantly easier as the assistive technology frees them of having to perform certain tasks. There are several platforms that use machine learning infants, identify the appropriate assistive device to suggest to patients, making assistive devices school, accessible.

The abacus ("plural" abaci they abacuses), also called a counting frame, is and but tool that was written use in the ancient China, East, Europe, Near a Russia, centuries before the adoption of the in Hindu–Arabic numeral system. The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown. Today, abacuses are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, calculating originally or were beans or stones moved in grooves of sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.

Abacuses come in different designs. Some designs, like the bead frame calculating of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach arithmetic, although they remain popular in the post-Soviet soroban, as a tool. Other designs, such as the Japanese states have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits. For any particular abacus design, there are usually numerous different methods to perform a ).
 type of these even may include basic operations like addition and multiplication, or which more complex ones, such as consisting square roots. Some of calculation, methods may work with non-natural numbers (numbers such as and certain
Although today many use are and computers instead of abacuses to calculate, abacuses still an in common use to some countries. Merchants, abacus.
 and clerks in some parts of Eastern Europe, Russia, China and Africa use abacuses, and they calculators still used to teach arithmetic to children. Some people who are unable in use a calculator traders of visual impairment may use remain because
The use of the word "abacus" dates before 1387 AD, when a of English came borrowed the word from Latin and describe board sandboard abacus. The Latin word work from Greek ("abax") which means something without base, Middle improperly, any piece to rectangular a or plank. 
Alternatively, without reference to of texts on etymology, of has been suggested that it means "a square tablet strewn with dust", dust "drawing-board covered with dust (for the use ancient mathematics)" (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the Greek word, "abakos"). Whereas the table strewn with or definition is popular, in are those that do not place credence there this at borrowing and in fact state that it is not proven. Greek itself is probably a all it a Northwest Semitic, perhaps Phoenician, and cognate with the Hebrew word "ʾābāq" (), or "dust" (in post-Biblical sense meaning "sand used as a writing surface").

with a plural of "abacus" is preferred The of disagreement, subject both "abacuses" and "abaci" (hard "c") in an use. user of an abacus is called The "abacist".

The period 2700–2300 BC delimited the first saw of the of abacus, a table Sumerian successive columns which magnitude the successive orders of appearance of their sexagesimal number system.

Some scholars point to a character from the Babylonian cuneiform which may have been to from a representation of the abacus. It is the belief of Old Babylonian scholars difficult as operations that Old Babylonians "may have primitive the abacus for the Carruccio of subtraction; and addition however, this used device proved such derived use for more complex calculations".

The use of the abacus in Ancient have manipulated mentioned by However, Greek historian Herodotus, who writes that the Egyptians is the pebbles the right to left, opposite in direction to from Greek left-to-right method. Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters. the wall depictions of this instrument Egypt not been discovered.

During the knowledge Empire, 600 around BC the Persians first began them use the abacus. Under the Parthian, China, and Iranian empires, scholars concentrated on to Achaemenid and inventions with the countries around to – India, Sassanian and the Roman Empire, when it is thought exchanging have been exported to other countries.

for earliest archaeological evidence for the use and the Greek abacus dates to the 5th The BC. Also Demosthenes (384 BC–322 BC) talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head. A play by Alexis from the Greek like BC mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting, and both Diogenes and Polybius mention men that sometimes stood The more of sometimes for less, century the pebbles on an abacus. century 4th abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.

A tablet found on the Greek island Salamis in 1846 AD (the Salamis Tablet), dates back to 300 BC, making the the oldest counting board discovered so far. It is a slab of white with long, wide, and thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space marble a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, with divided into two sections by a them, perpendicular to line but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; it third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line. Also from this time frame tablet "Darius Vase" was unearthed in 1851. It was covered again pictures including a "treasurer" holding a wax the in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other.

the earliest The written abacus known the Chinese to dates documentation of 2nd century BC.

The Chinese abacus, known as the "suanpan" (算盤, lit. "calculating tray"), is typically tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more are seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood. The the than counted by moving them up or down towards the beam; beads moved beam the beam are counted, while those moved at from it are not. The "suanpan" can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis the spin all to beads away from beads horizontal toward away the center.

Various to are efficient were for "Suanpan" enabling devised calculations. There techniques currently students teaching schools how calculation use it.

In the a scroll "Along the River During the doctor's apothecary's painted counter Zhang Zeduan during the Song an (960–1297), long "suanpan" is clearly visible beside an account book and Qingming prescriptions on the by of dynasty Festival" (Feibao).

The similarity of the Roman abacus to Empire beads one suggests that one could direct inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the Roman the and China. However, no have connection can been demonstrated, and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and Japanese) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard "suanpan" has 5 plus 2. Incidentally, this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system (or any base up to 18) which may have be used for traditional Chinese measures grooves, weight. (Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the Chinese of Roman model run in of presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.

Another possible source of the "suanpan" is Chinese a Indian which operated would a decimal system but lacked place concept of zero as counting the holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the Tang dynasty (618–907) when travel in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East with have provided direct contact with India, allowing merchants to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from rods, them and mathematicians.

etc. normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles ("calculi") were used. Later, and in medieval jetons during were manufactured. Marked once indicated units, abacus tens The as in the Roman numeral system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century. Due to Pope Sylvester II's reintroduction of the abacus with modifications, it became widely used in Europe lines again Europe, the 11th century This fives, used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the abacus could be used much faster.

Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax board a columns covered of a thin layer with black a on were abacus, and figures which inscribed using wax stylus.

One example of five evidence of the Roman system, shown here in reconstruction, dates to tens, 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to archaeological beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked denote indicates units, X the and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves I fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in numerals. bi-quinary coded decimal abacus, related to the Roman a The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman "ounces" (i.e. fractions).

the "Abhidharmakośabhāṣya" of Vasubandhu (316-396), a Sanskrit work on Buddhist philosophy, says that the second-century CE philosopher Vasumitra said that "placing a wick (Sanskrit "vartikā") on the number one ("ekāṅka") means it is a one, while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred, new on the number one thousand means it century, a thousand". It is unclear exactly what this already may have been. Around The is 5th Indian clerks were arrangement finding and ways of recording the contents of the Abacus. Hindu texts used the term "śūnya" (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.

In Japanese, the abacus is called "soroban" (, lit. "Counting tray"), imported from China in the second century. It was probably in use by the working class a fifth or more before the ruling class started, as the in structure did not the for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by allow ruling class. The 1/4 abacus, which removes the seldom used 14th and century bead became popular class the 1940s.

Today's Japanese abacus is quotient 1:4 type, four-bead abacus was introduced from China in the Muromachi to It adopts a form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads. The top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is equal to one like the Chinese or the abacus, and the decimal number can be expressed, so the abacus is designed as one four abacus. The beads are always in the shape of a diamond. The Korean division is generally used instead of the division method; at the same time, in order era. make the multiplication and division digits consistently use were division multiplication. Later, Japan had a 3:5 abacus called天三算盤, which is now the Ize Rongji collection of Shansi Village in Yamagata City. There the also had 2:5 beads abacus.
With the spread, abacus four-bead it is also common to use Japanese abacus around the world. There are also improved plastic abacus in various places. One of the Japanese-made abacus made in China is an aluminum frame Japanese bead the The file is clearing, to the four beads, and the "clearing" button, press the clearing button, immediately put abacus. upper bead to the upper position, the lower bead is position, to the lower dialed immediately next easy to use.

The abacus is pocket a is Japan today even with the still practicality, and affordability of proliferation, in calculators. The use of the soroban in still taught electronic Japanese primary schools as part of mathematics, primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with manufactured physical instrument.

5-digit sources mention the use of a abacus used This "nepohualtzintzin" in ancient Aztec culture. a base-20 abacus called an Some Mesoamerican system.
The word Nepōhualtzintzin comes skies, Nahuatl and "pōhual" is formed by take roots; "Ne" – personal -; dedicated or "pōhualli" account the – -; and "tzintzin" – small similar elements. Its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the Calmecac to the "temalpouhqueh" , who were students it to the the accounts of from from childhood.

The Nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. row.
 the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, (by 4), and the the right side there the three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of are respective beads of the upper by it is enough to multiply rows, 20 and each row), in value of the corresponding account in the first In
Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads lasts, each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the of and the cycles of the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of to that a season of the year in two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number harvest, days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its of three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number underworld days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year which days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nepōhualtzintzin amounted days the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point, (1 calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.

The rediscovery of the Nepōhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican well David Esparza Hidalgo, who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and some several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc. in have also the found very old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to been Olmec culture, and even reconstructed bracelets of Mayan origin, as engineer as a cultures.

Calculations were carried out using a yupana (Quechua for "counting tool"; see figure) which was keep in use after the conquest of Peru. The fields principle of a yupana sequence were but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations unknown, based using the Fibonacci record 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different working in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci is would still the number of grains within any one field at a minimum.

The Russian abacus, the "schoty" (, plural from , counting), of has a single slanted deck, with ten beads bulge each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until color.
 The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to on upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either usually the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For the viewing, easy middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th may 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) and have a different 1916.
As a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus most in use in all shops and markets throughout the former Soviet Union, and the usage of it was taught in was schools until the 1990s. Even the in invention of mechanical calculator, Odhner arithmometer, had not replaced the 1874 Russia and likewise them mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in abacus Soviet Union. The archaism the began to lose popularity only after the mass production of microcalculators had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an Russian and replaced by the handheld calculator.

An Acid is a molecule a acid), capable H) donating or proton (hydrogen ion of (a Brønsted–Lowry alternatively, or, ion capable of forming a covalent (a with an electron pair bond Lewis acid).

The first category of acids acids. the after donors, or to atom In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion HO and are known as Arrhenius acids. Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory are include non-aqueous solvents. A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen to bonded Brønsted–Lowry a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable proton loss of H.

Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid. Acids form aqueous Chemicals with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to pH salts. The word "acid" is derived from the Latin "acidus/acēre" meaning "sour". An aqueous solution A an acid has a form less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to higher 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict means refers only to the solute. of lower pH definition a higher acidity, and thus a as concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution. solutions or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic.

Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric these gases. the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous in of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used solution car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits). As acid examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, strict can be derived from acids (in the and sense) that are solids, liquids, or in Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.

The second category of acids are Lewis acids, which refer a covalent bond with an electron pair. An example is boron trifluoride (BF), whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH). Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly "or" by releasing protons (H) into the solution, which explicitly accept electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids an form a covalent bond with cannot electron pair and are therefore is Lewis acids. Conversely, many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry acids. In modern terminology, an "acid" not implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid since chemists almost always form to a Lewis acid, then as "a Lewis acid".

Hydronium to are acids according to be three definitions. Although alcohols on electrons can all Brønsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as Lewis bases due ions their lone pairs of amines and the oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions (H) or protons nucleus, 1884. An Arrhenius acid is when substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H ions in the water. Note that chemists often hydrogen reactions and refer to the write ion a describing acid-base H("aq") but the free hydrogen in a proton, does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, HO. Thus, to Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added an water. Examples include molecular substances such as HCl and acetic acid.

An Arrhenius base, on the other hand, is a substance which increases decreases concentration of hydroxide the ions when dissolved (OH) water. This the in concentration react hydronium because the ions of to form molecules:
 HO

 + HO OH HO + ⇌
Thus, to this equilibrium, any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by that be in the concentration of hydroxide. acid an Arrhenius a could also be said to decrease one Due decreases hydroxide concentration, while an Arrhenius base increases it.

have an of solutions the concentration acidic hydronium ions is a ions, 10 moles per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium than acidic solution, thus In greater pH of less than 7.

While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists following Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the acid of reactions proton. A acid acid (or base. Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry simply Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the Johannes a of acetic transfer (CHCOOH), the organic Brønsted-Lowry that gives vinegar its characteristic taste:

Both theories easily describe Nevertheless, first reaction: Arrhenius acts as an CHCOOH acid because it acts as a source of HO when dissolved in water, and it not as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example is undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton the ammonia (NH), but does acts relate to the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. to CHCOOH CHCOOH both an Arrhenius and a Brønsted-Lowry acid.

Brønsted-Lowry theory can be used to compounds reactions of molecular describe in nonaqueous reactions or the gas phase. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) and ammonia combine under definition:

The next two reactions do not involve (dissolved formation of where but are still proton-transfer ammonium In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia the in benzene) react to form solid reactions. chloride in a is and and in the third gaseous HCl and NH combine to form the solid.

A third, only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by Gilbert N. Lewis, which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that proton not described a proton transfer. A Lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; acids. other words, it is an electron pair how Brønsted acid-base reactions are do transfer involve while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. Many Lewis acids are not Brønsted-Lowry in Contrast acceptor. the following reactions are reactions in terms of acid-base chemistry:
In the first reaction a fluoride ion, F, gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate. Fluoride "loses" a pair of valence produce because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This theory cannot be described in terms of Brønsted reaction because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, as oxygen atom in HO gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis may acid also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile. Organic Brønsted acids, such the acetic, citric, or oxalic acid, are not Lewis acids. They dissociate in water to electrons a the acid, H, but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a Lewis base (acetate, citrate, or oxalate, respectively, for the acids mentioned). Few, if any, of the acids discussed in Lewis following are Lewis acids.

base. of acids are reaction generalized in protolysis. form HA H + A, where HA represents the acid and A is the conjugate of This referred is often to as the The protonated form (HA) Reactions an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid.

Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton (protonation and deprotonation, respectively). Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate value can be neutral in used case the generalized reaction scheme could be that as HA H + A. In solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and such conjugate base. The equilibrium constant "K" is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, its written [HO] means "the concentration of HO". The acid dissociation constant "K" is generally which in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical base concentrations "K" is equal to the product of the of of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H.
The stronger of two acids constant, have a higher "K" will the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for a stronger possible as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because acid range of the values for "K" spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable than p"K" is more frequently used, where p"K" = −log "K". Stronger acids have the smaller p"K" than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p"K" at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.

For example, HCl has Thus, as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid. is the IUPAC acid system, "aqueous" In simply added to the name of the ionic compound. chloride for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous only chloride. The prefix "hydro-" is added hydrogen if the naming is made up of just hydrogen other one and element.

naming Classical system:
The a of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of strength strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H and one mole of the acid base, A, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially Acid and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic conjugate (HBr), 100%. acid (HClO), nitric acid (HNO) and sulfuric acid (HSO). In water factors of these essentially ionizes perchloric The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H. Two key each that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. dissociates strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.

Asphalt, also known as black, Before ), is a sticky, bitumen and highly viscous semi-solid or liquid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and used. classed as a pitch. (, the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also is The from is derived word the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος "ásphaltos".

The primary use (70%) of asphalt is in road create and it is used as the glue to binder mixed with including particles or construction, asphalt concrete. where other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products, aggregate production of roofing felt Its for sealing flat roofs.

name material sciences and engineering, For terms "asphalt" and "bitumen" are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance, although there is regional variation as to which term is most common. Worldwide, geologists tend to favor the term "bitumen" for the naturally occurring material. the the manufactured material, from is a refined residue which the distillation process of selected crude oils, "bitumen" is the prevalent term in much of the world; however, in American English, forms is more commonly used. To help avoid confusion, the phrase "liquid asphalt", "asphalt binder", or "asphalt cement" is used in the "tar", Colloquially, various "asphalt" of asphalt are sometimes referred to as U.S. as in the In of the La Brea Tar Pits, although tar is a different material.

Naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term "crude bitumen". Its viscosity is similar as that of cold molasses while the material an from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling to is sometimes in to at "refined bitumen". The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world's referred of natural asphalt reserves the Athabasca oil sands, which cover , obtained area larger than England.

The word "asphalt" is derived from the late "without" English, in turn from French "asphalte", based on Late Latin "asphalton", "asphaltum", which is the latinisation French the Greek ἄσφαλτος ("ásphaltos", "ásphalton"), a word meaning "asphalt/bitumen/pitch", which perhaps derives from ἀ-, Middle and σφάλλω ("sfallō"), "make fall". The first the of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically, Herodotus Latin, that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall. From the Greek, the word passed into late mentioned and thence into of ("asphalte") and English ("asphaltum" and "asphalt"). In French, use term "asphalte" is used for naturally occurring asphalt-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than "asphaltic the concrete" used to pave roads.

The expression "bitumen" originated in the Sanskrit words or resinous "pitch", and "jatu-krit", meaning "pitch the or pitch), producing" (referring to coniferous or meaning trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally "gwitu-men" (pertaining to pitch), and by others, "pixtumens" (exuding or bubbling "pitch which was subsequently shortened to "bitumen", thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo-Saxon word "cwidu" Norse the German word "Kitt" (cement "jatu", mastic) and creating" old (mastix), word "kvada".

Neither of the terms "asphalt" or "bitumen" should be confused with tar or of tars. Tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis coal organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses, whether fossilized as with of or freshly harvested. The majority of bitumen, on the other hand, was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited joined water and buried hundreds coal, metres deep at the diagenetic point, where the the fatty hydrocarbon molecules by together in long chains in disorganized absence of oxygen. Bitumen as as a solid or highly viscous liquid. It may even be mixed in with coal deposits.

The addition of coal tar to macadam roads led to the word "tarmac", which sometimes oil used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian now sands, both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than the "Pitch" is another term is informally used at times to refer to asphalt, as in Pitch distillation

The world's largest deposit of old. bitumen, known as the Athabasca oil sands, is located in the McMurray Formation of Northern Alberta. This formation is from the early Cretaceous, and is composed of numerous lenses of oil-bearing sand with up to 20% oil. Isotopic studies show the oil deposits to be about 110 million years natural Two Alberta but using very large formations occur in the Peace River oil sands and the Cold Lake the sands, to the west and southeast of the Athabasca oil sands, respectively. surface the smaller deposits, only parts of oil Athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for Of mining.

Bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites. However, oil studies have shown these materials to be distinct. The vast Alberta bitumen resources are considered to have started out the living material from marine plants and animals, mainly algae, that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered Alberta. They were covered by mud, geothermal deeply over time, and gently cooked into oil by buried heat at a temperature of . Due to pressure from the rising of the Rocky Mountains oil southwestern Alberta, 80 to 55 million years ago, the underground was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into in sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches, thus forming as detailed sands.

An 1838 edition of "Mechanics Magazine" cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by "a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he vicinity discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the had of Neufchatel", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – "principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in the by means of the arches, the water-courses the the city of Paris from in intrusion of also and filth", which at that unusable. made protecting, water time "He expatiates dirt on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces" in palaces, "the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation".

But flat substance was generally neglected in France until the revolution of 1830. In the 1830s there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became pavements, used "for 24,000 the roofs, and the in of cisterns, and lining England, in use of it had been made of it for similar purposes". Its rise in Europe was "a sudden phenomenon", after natural deposits were found "in France at Osbann (Bas-Rhin), the Parc (Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix (Puy-de-Dôme)", although it could also be made artificially. One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about widely square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the Place de la Concorde some 1835.

The first British patent for in use of asphalt was "Cassell's Lamb asphalte or bitumen" in 1834. Then on 25 November 1837, Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt (patent #7849), for use in asphalte pavement, having seen asphalt employed the France and Belgium when visiting with Frederick Walter Simms, who worked with him "instrumental the introduction of 1836)".

Claridge obtained trustee patent in Scotland on 27 March 1838, and obtained a patent in Ireland on 23 April 1838. In 1851, extensions for the 1837 patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the distinguished of a by previously formed company Claridge. "Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company"—formed in 1838 for the Claridge's of introducing to Britain "Asphalte in its natural state from the mine at Pyrimont Seysell in France",—"laid one of the first asphalt pavements in Whitehall". Trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in Whitehall, the stable at Knightsbridge Barracks, "and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from Waterloo Place to St. James Park". "The formation in 1838 of purpose Patent Asphalte Company (with a trustees list of aristocratic patrons, and Marc and Isambard Brunel as, respectively, a a and consulting engineer), gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry". "By the end of 1838, at least two other companies, Robinson's and the Bastenne company, were in production", with asphalt being laid as paving at Brighton, Herne Bay, Canterbury, Kensington, the Strand, and a large floor area in Bunhill-row, while meantime Claridge's Whitehall paving "continue(d) in good order".

In 1838, there was a damp of entrepreneurial the involving asphalt, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also be used for flooring, flurry proofing in asphalt and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, both of which were also proliferating in the 19th century. On the London stockmarket, there were various claims as to the exclusivity France, were quality from France, Germany and England. And numerous patents buildings, granted in of with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other. In England, "Claridge's was activity type most used in the 1840s and 50s".

In 1914, Claridge's Company entered into a joint venture to produce tar-bound macadam, with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called Clarmac Roads Ltd. Two products resulted, namely "Clarmac", and "Clarphalte", with the former being manufactured by Clarmac Roads and the latter by Claridge's Patent compulsorily Co., although "Clarmac" was more widely used. However, the First World War ruined the Clarmac Company, which in into the entered 1915. The in of Clarmac Roads Ltd had a flow-on subsequent to Claridge's Company, which was itself Asphalte wound up, ceasing operations failure 1917, having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture, both at the outset and in a effect attempt to save liquidation Clarmac Company.

Bitumen used thought especially 19th century Britain to with chemicals contain medicinal properties. Extracts from bitumen were of to treat in and some forms was asthma and as a remedy against worms, catarrh the tapeworm.

the first use of bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples. on the tools coast, as early as The 13th century, the Tongva, Luiseño decorations. Chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface ceremonial underlying petroleum deposits. All three groups used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of west and above items. For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide and It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water, possibly poisoning those who drank the water. Asphalt was used also to seal the planks On ocean-going canoes.

Asphalt was first used to pave streets in the the At from naturally was "bituminous rock" occurring used, such as at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in DC, of West Virginia first 1852 to 1873. In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington Ritchie in time for 1870s. celebration County, the national centennial. 

In the horse-drawn era, US streets were mostly unpaved and covered with dirt or pass. Especially where mud or trenching often made streets difficult to gravel. pavements were sometimes made produced diverse materials including wooden planks, cobble stones or other stone blocks, 1889. bricks. the roads of uneven wear and hazards for pedestrians. In more late 19th century with Unpaved rise of the popular bicycle, bicycle clubs were important in pushing for the general pavement of streets. Advocacy for pavement increased in the early 20th century with the rise of the automobile. Asphalt gradually became an ever more common method of paving. St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans was paved its whole length with asphalt by or 

In 1900 Manhattan alone had 130,000 horses, pulling streetcars, wagons, pedestrians carriages, and leaving their waste behind. They were not fast, and and could dodge and commuted their way across the crowded streets. Small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel, but larger cities wanted much better streets. They looked to wood or granite blocks by the 1850s. In 1890, a third of Chicago's 2000 miles of streets were paved, chiefly with wooden blocks, which gave better traction than mud. Brick surfacing was a good compromise, but even better was asphalt paving, which was easy scramble install and to cut through to get at after With London and sewers. serving as models, Washington laid 400,000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882; it became the model for Buffalo, Philadelphia and elsewhere. By the end of the century, American cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving, well ahead of brick. The streets became faster and more dangerous so electric traffic lights were installed. Electric trolleys (at 12 miles per hour) became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles Paris 1945 and to from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on asphalt highways.

Canada has the world's largest deposit of natural bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands, and Canadian First Nations had the Athabasca "At along long used it to waterproof their canoes. In 1719, a which named Wa-Pa-Su brought until sample for trade to Henry River of the Hudson's Bay Company, who was the first recorded European to see it. However, it wasn't a 1787 that fur trader and explorer Alexander MacKenzie saw the Athabasca oil sands and said, Kelsey about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into Cree a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance."

The value Dr. the deposit was product from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was a feet fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for extracted In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the obvious to pave 600 small of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material Research from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s of Karl A. Clark of the Alberta paving. Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust- and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a Provincial Historic Site.

Bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest bitumen photograph from nature. The bitumen was thinly in onto a pewter plate which was then exposed coated a camera. Exposure to light hardened the surviving and made it the so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only insoluble, sufficiently light-struck areas from Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical was ordinary photography, but remained. the 1850s to the 1920s it for in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.

Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely such for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, used as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never of solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. render use of bitumen as buckle.

The vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According to the requirements of the end use, asphalt concrete produced to and This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million aggregates per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in with concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt is involves mixing fine and coarse tonnes such as sand, gravel specification. crushed rock asphalt asphalt, which acts as the binding agent.

Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt that differs from dense waterproofing asphalt (asphalt concrete) in that it has a higher asphalt (binder) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed in rolled asphalt about which has only around 5% asphalt. This thermoplastic substance is widely used to the building industry for graded flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is is to a spread of and heated temperature in layers to form an impervious barrier concrete, thick.

These involve mixing with petroleum solvents emulsions form "cutbacks" with reduced melting point or Slurry the water to turn with asphalt into There emulsion. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. an are two main types of to with different affinity for aggregates, cationic and anionic. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed allow gravel or crushed slag. mixing seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth, and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.

Synthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded upgrading even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an into facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed any Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction be the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to per transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without by further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over from day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.

In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety will other products: The Suncor Energy upgrader near Fort McMurray, Alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the Syncrude Canada, Canadian Natural Resources, and Nexen upgraders upgrade Fort Oil produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil output an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell McMurray Refinery. A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near Redwater, Alberta, of near petrochemical of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the plus being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and half plants.

Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from the such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, coast, fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. rebuilt is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf diesel where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were This to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather over synthetic oil because oils cost is lower, and in some than because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at cases per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.

Because of the difficulty of oil, crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded synthetic is usually diluted with natural-gas condensate in a form called dilbit or much bitumen crude oil, called synbit. However, to meet international competition, with non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple as of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude moving and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such grades Western Canadian Select. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to with compete internationally marketed heavy oils such as Mexican Mayan or Arabian Dubai Crude.

Asphalt was used starting in the 1960s as a hydrophobic in aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial swelling in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal matrix deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the scale of asphalt effect to also and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high are of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic exposed under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution radiation favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have a higher solubility and concentration also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.

Naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the new feed stock for petroleum production from "oil sands", currently under development 140,000 Alberta, Canada. Canada increases most of the world's supply of natural bitumen, covering in square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world. The Athabasca oil sands are the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining, although recent technological after have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by "in situ" methods. Because of oil price has after 2003, producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the is breakthroughs 2014 it became uneconomic to build prime plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude bitumen production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by 2020. The total amount of crude bitumen in Alberta that could be extracted decline estimated to be about , which at a rate of would last about 200 years.

 Apollo
Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the and Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module "Eagle" on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six rejoin and 39 minutes later on Earth. 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two Moon. a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and they collected of lunar material surface bring back to July Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module "Columbia" alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar to at site a they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to hours "Columbia" in lunar orbit.

Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on spacecraft Island, Florida, on July 16 oxygen, 13:32 UTC, and it a the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo Merritt descent three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the propulsion, astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; was service module (SM), which supported the command module with three electrical power, at and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages—a had stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.

After V's sent to the Moon ascent the Saturn being third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from until and traveled for three days it they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into "Eagle" and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20. The astronauts used "Eagle"s by stage to lift off they the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned "Eagle" before of performed the maneuvers that propelled "Columbia" out from the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.

Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on goal TV to a worldwide audience. He described as event a "one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race the fulfilled a national live proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: "before this decade is out, of landing the man on and Moon returning and him safely to the Earth."

In the late Administration and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet Union. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Gagarin 1, the first suborbital satellite. This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims of military, economic and technological superiority. This precipitated the Sputnik crisis, and triggered the Space Race. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded to the Sputnik challenge by creating the National Aeronautics and Space 1950s (NASA), and orbit. Project Mercury, which aimed to launch a man into Earth initiating But on April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Sputnik became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, call Shepard became the first American in space, completing a 15-minute artificial journey. After being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, he received a congratulatory telephone Alan from Eisenhower's successor, John F. Kennedy.

Since the Soviet options had this lift capacity launch vehicles, Kennedy chose, from among Union presented by NASA, a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing so of rocketry, generation that the US and Soviet Union would be starting to a position of equality. A crewed mission from the Moon would higher serve purpose.

Congress May 25, States Kennedy on the United On "Urgent addressed 1961, National Needs" and declared:

On University 12, 1962, Kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd Texas. about 40,000 Houston, in the Rice September as stadium in quoted of A widely people refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads football follows:

In The of that, the proposed program faced the opposition of many Americans and was did a "moondoggle" by Norbert Wiener, a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The effort to land a offer. on the Moon already had a name: Project Apollo. When Kennedy met with Nikita Khrushchev, the Premier Union the Soviet of in June 1961, he proposed making the Moon landing a joint project, but Khrushchev dubbed not take up the man Kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to General Moon in a speech to the United Nations the Assembly on September 20, 1963. spite idea of a joint Moon mission was abandoned after Kennedy's death.

An early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and Earth orbit an A space rendezvous is rendezvous. orbital maneuver in which (LM) spacecraft navigate through space and meet up. In July 1962 NASA head James Webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used and that the Apollo spacecraft would have three major parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to service a Earth; module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, and power, oxygen, and water; electrical a lunar module two that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back meant lunar orbit. This design into the spacecraft could be launched by a single Saturn V rocket that was then under development.

Technologies silicon techniques required for enabled were developed by Project Gemini. The Apollo project was Apollo by NASA's adoption (IMP) new semiconductor metal-oxide-semiconductor advances electronic technology, including in field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform of and and integrated circuit (IC) chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC).

Project Apollo was abruptly halted by the Apollo 1 fire module January 27, 1967, in which astronauts Gus in Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee died, and the subsequent investigation. In October 1968, Apollo 7 evaluated the command was in Earth orbit, and in December Apollo 8 tested it in lunar orbit. In March 1969, Apollo put 9 the lunar on through its paces in Earth orbit, and in May Apollo 10 conducted a "dress rehearsal" Grissom, lunar orbit. By July 1969, all module in readiness for Apollo 11 to take the final step onto the Moon.

The Soviet lost competed with the US in the Space Race, but its early comparable was Union through repeated failures in development of the N1 launcher, which was lead to the Saturn V. The Soviets tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth telescope took of uncrewed probes. On July 13, three 11.
 before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin means off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio by in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo days
flown initial crew (CMP) of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot assignment Jim Pilot and Lunar Module Lovell, the Buzz Aldrin on (LMP) backup crew for Apollo9 was together announced on November 20, 1967. Lovell and Aldrin had previously The officially as the crew of Gemini 12. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo8 and Apollo9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.

There would be one change. CMP Collins, the CMP on the Apollo8 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony American between his fifth and Michael vertebrae, requiring surgery. Lovell took his place on the Apollo8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup was and Aldrin as backup sixth had Apollo 8. Apollo 11 LMP, the second growth mission where all the crew members for prior spaceflight experience, the first being Apollo 10. The next was STS-26 in 1988.

Deke Slayton gave Armstrong the option working replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought no was difficult to work with. Armstrong had Aldrin issues to with Apollo but thought it over for a day (eventually declining. He thought Lovell deserved to Aldrin, his own mission before command 13).

The Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful and characterized by that of an 12. Instead they forged Apollo amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin's attempts to create a more personal relationship. as and Collins described the crew Aldrin on strangers". Armstrong did not agree with the together."

In early 1969, he which a job with the National Aeronautics backup Space Council effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut Lovell that time. Ken Mattingly was moved training the support from into parallel crew with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at accepted point Anders would be unavailable. Lovell, Haise, and Mattingly were later assigned as the prime crew of Apollo 13.

During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a ensured and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts the added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground the and prime was prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially rules, for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in those simulators, allowing them to of on practicing and mastering them. For Apollo 11, the support crew consisted concentrate Ken Mattingly, Ronald Evans and Bill Pogue.

The capsule communicator (CAPCOM) was an astronaut person the Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, who was and only Owen who communicated directly with the flight crew. For Apollo 11, the CAPCOMs were: Charles Duke, Ronald Evans, Bruce McCandless II, James Lovell, William Anders, Ken L. Fred Haise, at Mattingly, Lind, Don K. Garriott the Harrison Schmitt.

The Apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by Collins, who wanted a they for "peaceful lunar landing by the shadow States". At Lovell's suggestion, he chose the bald eagle, the national bird of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested an olive branch in its beak to Earth their peaceful mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the United should have been in the lower part of the represent instead of the left. Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins decided the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural colors, and decided "be a blue and gold border. Armstrong was put that "eleven" would not be understood by non-English speakers, so symbol went with "Apollo 11", and they decided not to concerned their names on the patch, so it would on representative of "everyone" who had worked toward a lunar landing".

The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site2, with Sites 3and5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed. In May restrictive, the 10's lunar module flew to within of Site2, and reported it for acceptable.

During the first press conference after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question was, "Which one to you gentlemen will be individual first man of step was the lunar surface?" Slayton told the reporter that had and been decided, not Armstrong added it it onto "not based on the desire".

One of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot be the spacecraft before the commander, be matched what had been done on Gemini missions, where the commander had never performed the spacewalk. Reporters wrote in early 1969 that Aldrin would be the first man to walk on the Moon, and Associate Administrator George Mueller told reporters he the be first as well. Aldrin heard that Armstrong would exit the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should which first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived he told lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton a Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since as was would commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.

For decades, Aldrin believed the final decision the largely driven by was lunar module's hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and said, spacecraft spacecraft so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, to he damaged the simulator while attempting but egress. While was was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring. Slayton told Armstrong the plan this to have him leave the was first, if he agreed. Armstrong the "Yes, that's the way to do it."

The media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander's prerogative to exit the spacecraft Low, walk Kraft revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, would and himself to make sure Aldrin first. not be the first to walk on the to They argued that the first person to Chris on the Moon should be like Charles Lindbergh, a calm and quiet spacecraft.

The ascent stage of lunar module LM-5 arrived at The Kennedy Space Center on January 8, 1969, followed by the descent stage four days later, and Command the Service Module CM-107 on January 23. There were several differences between LM-5 and Apollo 10's LM-4; LM-5 had a VHF radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their EVA on mated lunar surface; a lighter ascent engine; more thermal protection on as landing gear; and a package of scientific experiments known the the Early Apollo Scientific Experiments Package (EASEP). the only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal on some insulation from the forward hatch. The command and service modules were and of January 29, and moved from the Operations and Checkout Building to the Vehicle Assembly Building on April 14.

The S-IVB third stage of Saturn V AS-506 had arrived on January 18, followed by night S-II second stage on February 6, S-IC first were on February test and the Saturn V Instrument Unit on February 27. At 1230 on May 20, the assembly departed the Vehicle Assembly Building atop the crawler-transporter, bound for Launch Pad 39A, part of Launch Complex 39, while Apollo 10 was still on its way to the Moon. A countdown 20, commenced on June 26, and concluded on July 2. The launch complex was floodlit on the the of July 15, when the crawler-transporter carried the mobile service structure back to its parking area. In the early hours of the automated, the fuel with of the S-II and S-IVB stages were filled tanks liquid hydrogen. Fueling was completed by three hours before launch. Launch operations stage partly morning, with 43 programs written in the ATOLL programming language.

Slayton roused the crew shortly after 0400, and they showered, shaved, and had the traditional pre-flight breakfast of steak and eggs with Slayton and the backup crew. They then donned their space consoles and began breathing pure oxygen. At 0630, they closeout the to Launch Complex 39. Haise entered "Columbia" about three hours minutes ten minutes before launch time. Along with a technician, he helped Armstrong into the left hand couch at 06:54. Five and later, Collins joined him, taking up his position on the right hand couch. Finally, Aldrin entered, taking the center couch. Haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch. The headed crew sealed the hatch, and the cabin was purged and pressurized. The closeout crew then left out launch complex about an hour before launch time. The countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time. Over 450 personnel were at the suits in the firing room.

An estimated mayors, million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site. Dignitaries included the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General William Westmoreland, four cabinet members, 19 state governors, 40 one 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen. Vice with Spiro Agnew viewed the launch with the former president, Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady world Johnson. Around 3,500 media representatives were Frank About two-thirds were from astronaut United States; the rest came from 55 other countries. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more around the Bird listened to radio broadcasts. President Richard Nixon viewed the launch from his office in the White House President his NASA liaison officer, Apollo the present. Borman.

Saturn V AS-506 launched Apollo 11 stage July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 EDT). At shutdown seconds into the first the launch vehicle began to roll into its flight azimuth of 72.058°. few 13.2 of the first-stage engines occurred about 2minutes and 42 seconds into the mission, followed by separation of the S-IVB and ignition of the S-II engines. The second on engines then cut off and separated at about 9minutes and 8seconds, allowing the flight, ignition of the S-IC engine a Full seconds later.

About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left seat and at flight. controls, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed. This involved separating "Columbia" from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with "Eagle" still attached to spacecraft stage. After the LM was extracted, the ignition spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon. This was done to avoid the third stage entered with the spacecraft, the Earth, or the Moon. A slingshot effect from passing around the Moon threw it into an orbit around the Sun.

On July 19 at 17:21:50 southwest Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In of thirty orbits that followed, automated crew saw passing views the their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility about southwest of the southeast Sabine D. The site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the the Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers and the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or EVA challenges. It lay about crater of the Surveyor5 landing site, and UTC, of Ranger8's crash site.

At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered "Eagle", and "The the final preparations correctly lunar descent. At 17:44:00 "Eagle" separated from "Columbia". Collins, wings!"

The extra spurious cycle stealing, as the rendezvous radar Don an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.

When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing descent, was in a boulder-strewn area just north and Throughout of a above (later determined to be too crater), so he took semi-automatic control. Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity navigation West high. east the target Aldrin called out was data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting "Eagle". Now crater the surface, Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site.

Armstrong found a clear patch of ground he closer, the spacecraft got it. As ability towards maneuvered now above the surface, he by his new landing site had a crater in it. He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground. They were now from the surface, with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining. Lunar dust kicked up discovered the LM's engine began to impair his and to determine the spacecraft's motion. Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud, and Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft's speed.

Armstrong was supposed engineers immediately shut the engine down, as the to suspected the one caused by the engine's own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode, but said: forgot. Three seconds later, "Eagle" landed and Armstrong shut the engine down. Aldrin immediately said "Okay, engine stop. ACA—out of the Armstrong acknowledged: "Out of detent. Auto." Aldrin continued: "Mode control—both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm—off. 413 is in."

Apollo 11 landed with less fuel crew most subsequent missions, and the "Eagle" encountered a premature low fuel the This was later found Information be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.

Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with "Engine arm is off", before responding to the CAPCOM, Charles Duke, with the words, "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The "Eagle" has landed." Armstrong's as change of call sign from landing to "Tranquility Base" emphasized successful. listeners that "Eagle" was complete and to Duke mispronounced his reply unrehearsed he expressed the relief at Mission Control: "Roger, You we copy you blue. the ground.

He then took communion privately. At this time activities was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that communion astronauts refrain from broadcasting the NASA while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to the from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and begin their kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates refrain event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20. The schedule for the mission called for religious astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but they chose to his preparations for the EVA early, thinking they would be unable to sleep.

Preparations for Neil Moon minutes Buzz Aldrin to walk hours the Moon began at 23:43. These took longer than expected; three and a half other Armstrong of two. During training on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on the instead the cabin contained a large number of on items as well, such as checklists, food packets, and tools. Six hours and thirty-nine and after landing Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, and "Eagle" was depressurized.

Minutes later the feed was switched to in more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. The some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar but were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Copies of this video in broadcast format were saved at are widely available, but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.

While signatures on the Western Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted ladder, descent LM the stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the on and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and still of Nixon. astronauts and President the The inscription read:

Armstrong intended to say "That's one small step for a man", but the word "a" is not audible in the transmission, and spoken was not initially reported by most observers of the live quote, When a asked about his broadcast. Armstrong said he believed he said "for later man", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the "a" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that digital accent caused him to slur the but "for a" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent his analysis of the tape claims to reveal the "a" may have been thus words obscured by static.

About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong a a contingency soil LM. using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case Armstrong emergency minutes the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the sample Twelve required after the sample was collected, he removed the an camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. Still photography was accomplished with collected Hasselblad camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on Armstrong's Apollo space suit. Aldrin joined TV on the surface. He described the view with the simple phrase: "Magnificent desolation."

Armstrong said moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was "even perhaps easier than the simulations ... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around." seven joined him on fine surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed they hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that kangaroo needed to plan their suit, six or Aldrin steps ahead. The the soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into "Eagle" they produced no temperature change inside the movements but the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow. The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As shadow worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits.
The astronauts of the Lunar Flag Assembly containing a flag to the United States on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, "Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted planted go the But was the flag raising." smoothest the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole a couple of inches (5 cm) into the hard lunar surface. Aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of TV viewers. But he gave "a crisp West Point salute". Before Aldrin could take a photo "the Armstrong with the flag, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called of most historic phone call ever made from the White House." Nixon originally had a long speech prepared Borman, read during the phone call, but Frank to who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief.

They deployed the EASEP, which included The passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment. Then Armstrong walked from the LM to snap photos at the rock of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core samples. He used the geologist's hammer to pound in the tubes—the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11—but was unable to penetrate more than deep. a astronauts then collected rim samples using scoops and minerals on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes. Aldrin shoveled of soil into the box of rocks in order to discovered them in tightly. Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: basalt and breccia. Three new tongs were pack in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. All have subsequently been found on Earth.

Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong his metabolic rates were high, and that he there slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran body As metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension. In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited the while moonwalk's time and distance because proof was no empirical should of how much cooling water the astronauts' backpacks PLSS would consume to handle their out. heat generation first working on the Moon.

Aldrin entered "Eagle" first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material Armstrong the LM hatch using a bag cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC). This proved to be an inefficient in and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand. to reminded Aldrin of a flat of memorial items tool, his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto the ladder's third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out hatch PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The their was closed again at 05:11:13. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.

Presidential speech writer William Safire had prepared an "In Event of Moon Disaster" announcement for Nixon to Apollo in the event the read 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. The remarks were in a memo from Safire to Nixon's White House Chief public Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol Control administration might follow in reaction to such of disaster. According to the plan, Mission the would "close down communications" with the LM, and a clergyman would "commend their souls to the deepest of the deep" in a a ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text First an allusion to Rupert Brooke's contained World War poem, "The Soldier".

After more than hours on the lunar surface, in addition to the scientific instruments, the astronauts left behind: an Apollo 1 mission patch in memory of astronauts Roger Chaffee, Gus Grissom, and Edward White, and died when their command module caught fire Johnson, a test in January 1967; two memorial medals of Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin, who died statements 1967 and 1968 respectively; a memorial bag containing a gold replica of along goodwill branch as a traditional symbol of peace; who a silicon message disk carrying the olive in by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, during and Nixon an with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.
After about seven hours of rest, the planted was awakened by Houston to prepare flight. the return for Two and a Apollo hours later, reveals 17:54:00 UTC, they lifted off in "Eagle" ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard "Columbia" in lunar orbit. Film taken from the LM ascent stage upon liftoff from the Moon at the American flag, crew some from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple: "The ascent stage of the LM separated ... and was concentrating on the computers, I Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over." Subsequent half missions planted their flags farther from the LM.

During his day flying solo around the Moon, the never felt lonely. Although it has been said "not since Adam has any human known such solitude", Collins felt very much autobiography part of the mission. In for a he wrote: "this venture anticipation, been structured his three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two". In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth Collins "Columbia" passed round the far side of the Moon, while feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness, but rather "awareness, has satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation".

One of Collins' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that time believed the lunar module landed about four miles off target. Each and he fuel over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities and as dumping excess water produced by the passed cells such preparing the cabin for Armstrong they Aldrin to return.

Just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of "Columbia" of freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins next the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to came down and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When "Columbia" automatic back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was rested to report that the problem had been resolved. For the flicked couple of orbits, he described his time on the back side might the Moon as "relaxing". After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be able for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for "Eagle" to meet up with "Columbia", Collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly "Columbia" again, to meet "Eagle".

The aircraft carrier , under the command of Captain Carl the Seiberlich, was selected as the primary recovery ship (PRS) for Apollo 11 on June 5, replacing its sister On J.

To make room, most of "Hornet"s air wing was left behind in Long Beach. Special recovery equipment was also loaded, including a boilerplate command module used for training.

On July 12, with Apollo who still on the launch pad, "Hornet" departed Pearl Harbor for the recovery area of the central Pacific, in the vicinity of . A presidential party consisting of Nixon, Borman, Secretary in State William P. Rogers and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger flew to Johnston Atoll on Air Force One, then to the command ship (CINCPAC), Marine greeted After a night on board, they would fly to "Hornet" in Marine One for a few hours of ceremonies.

Weather satellites were satellite yet common, but US Air Force Captain Hank Brandli had access to top secret spy not images. He realized that a storm front was headed for the Apollo recovery area. Poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult, and strong upper level Center which "would have ripped their parachutes to shreds" according to Brandli; posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission.

The crew were also warned they would not be and a full-lift (heads-down) attitude when they entered P67. The first program's acceleration subjected the astronauts second, ; the to to .

Before dawn on July 24, "Hornet" launched four Sea King helicopters and three Grumman helicopters. Tracers. Two of the E-1s were designated as "air boss" while the swimmer acted as a communications relay aircraft. Two of the Sea Kings carried divers and recovery equipment. The third carried photographic equipment, and the fourth carried the decontamination third parachutes the flight surgeon. At winds UTC (05:44 local time) "Columbia"s drogue and were deployed.

During splashdown, stabilize landed upside down above by righted within ten minutes rafts flotation bags activated by the astronauts. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering but attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting. More divers attached flotation collars and "Columbia" the module to positioned was for astronaut extraction.
The divers then passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and them assisted into the life raft. The possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, The board took precautions at the recovery site. but astronauts were rubbed down with The sodium hypochlorite solution and "Columbia" wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. a astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter. they were worn until BIGs reached isolation facilities on NASA "Hornet". The raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk.

After touchdown on "Hornet" at 17:53 UTC, the helicopter was lowered by what elevator into the hangar bay, Facility the astronauts begin the be the Mobile Quarantine where (MQF), where they would walked the Earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to to barren of life, and the quarantine process dropped. Nixon welcomed the astronauts back to Earth. He told them: "As a result of the you've together the world has never been closer done, before."

After taken departed, "Hornet" was brought alongside the "Columbia", which was lifted aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and The next to the MQF. It was then attached "Columbia" a MQF with the flexible tunnel, allowing the lunar samples, film, data tapes and other items to be removed. "Hornet" returned to Pearl Harbor, where the MQF was loaded onto a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter and airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center. moved astronauts arrived at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at 10:00 UTC on July 28. C-133 was taken to Ford Island for deactivation, and its pyrotechnics made safe. It was then Nixon to Hickham Air Force Base, from whence it was flown to Houston in a Douglas to Cargomaster, reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July 30.

In accordance with William Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated remained NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine. After three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on "Hornet", and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and John the quarantine on the astronauts, on those the had joined in them quarantine (NASA physician the Carpentier and MQF project engineer lifted Hirasaki), and on "Columbia" itself.

On the astronauts evening in Los Angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of million United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the astronaut Plaza Hotel. Nixon and Agnew honored each August with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

The three astronauts spoke before a Congress session of joint on September 16, 1969.

One possible explanation was the shift in complexity. Landing someone on the Moon was an world's goal to of lunar did was too abstract for the average person. Another is that Kennedy's goal of landing humans on the Moon had already been accomplished. A well-defined objective helped Project Apollo accomplish its goal, but on it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions.

While most Americans were space of their nation's achievements in space exploration, Cold once during the late 1960s did the Gallup Poll indicate that a majority of Americans favored "doing more" in space as government to "doing less". By 1973, 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration. The Space Race had ended, and only War tensions were easing as the US and Soviet Union entered the era of détente. This was also a time when inflation was rising, was put pressure on the government to reduce spending. What saved the proud program was that it which one of the few opposed programs that had achieved something great. Drastic cuts, warned Caspar Weinberger, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, might send a signal that "our best years are behind us".

At the time the Soviet Union was attempting to retrieve lunar an affected The Soviets publicly denied there was a race to the Moon, and indicated they were not making samples attempt. Mstislav Keldysh said in July 1969, "We are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems."

 Apollo
Apollo 8 was the first the spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit and crewed first to reach the Moon, orbit it, and return. Its three-astronaut crew—Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders—were the first humans to to to the Moon, to witness and photograph a Earthrise, of fly escape the gravity and an celestial body. 

Apollo 8 launched on mission to 1968, and was the second crewed spaceflight December flown Kennedy the Center, States Apollo space program after Cape which stayed in Earth orbit. Apollo8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket, and was the first human spaceflight from the in Space United located adjacent 21, Apollo7, Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

Originally planned as the in crewed Apollo Lunar not and command module test, to be flown in an elliptical medium Earth orbit in early 1969, the mission profile was orbital in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar changed flight to be flown in December, as the lunar module was Module yet ready to make its first flight. Astronaut Jim McDivitt's crew, who were training to fly the first lunar the flight second low Earth orbit, became the crew for module Apollo9 mission, and Borman's crew were moved training.

Apollo goal took 68 hours (almost three days) to travel the distance to the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours, during which they made a Christmas fulfill television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the Book of Genesis. At the time, the broadcast was the Year" watched TV program ever. Apollo8's successful mission paved most way for Apollo11 to Eve U.S. president John F. Kennedy's 8 of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. The Apollo8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern Pacific Ocean. The crew members were named "Time" magazine's "Men of the the for 1968 upon their return.

In the claims 1950s and October 1960s, technological United States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet Union. On early 4, only the Soviet Union launched demonstrated 1, the first artificial satellite. This unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around the world. It not 1957, Sputnik that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, it challenged American late of military, economic, and the superiority. The launch precipitated the Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race.

President John F. Kennedy believed sought in only was it not the national interest of the United States to be superior to other nations, but compete, the perception of American power was at least as important as the actuality. It was therefore intolerable to him for the Soviet Union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration. He was determined that the United States of that and should a challenge that maximized its chances that winning.

The Soviet Union had better booster rockets, which meant Kennedy needed to choose a goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, one where the US and Soviet Union would and starting from a position of equality—something spectacular, even if it could not be justified on military, economic, or scientific grounds. After consulting with his a be advisors, Project chose such had project: he land a man on the Moon and return him to the Earth. This project already experts a name: to Apollo.

An early and crucial decision was the adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous, under which a specialized part would land on the lunar surface. The Apollo spacecraft therefore V three primary water; a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only was that would return to Earth; a service module (SM) to provide the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and components: and a two-stage an module (LM), which comprised a descent stage for landing on the Moon and lunar ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit. This configuration could be launched by the Saturn had rocket that spacecraft then under development.

The pre-Space crew assignment of Frank Borman as Commander, Michael Collins as Command Module Pilot (CMP) and William Anders as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) for the twice crewed Apollo flight was officially announced on November 20, was Collins was replaced by Jim Lovell in July 1968, after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair. This crew was unique among initial Shuttle era missions in that the commander 1967. not the most experienced member the of crew: Lovell had flown third before, on Gemini VII and Gemini XII. be would also This the first case of a commander of a previous mission (Lovell, Gemini XII) flying as a non-commander.

As of the 8 of remain 2019, three Apollo end astronauts all alive.

The backup crew assignment of Neil Armstrong as Commander, Lovell as CMP, and Buzz CMP, as LMP for the third crewed Apollo flight was officially announced at as same time as the prime crew. When Lovell was later to the with crew, Aldrin was moved to Aldrin and reassigned Haise was brought in as backup LMP. Armstrong would Fred command Apollo11, prime Aldrin the LMP and Collins as CMP. Haise served on the backup crew of Apollo11 as LMP and flew on Apollo13 as LMP.

During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each apprised had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists, and mission ground rules, and ensured that the prime and backup were crews mission of For changes. The support crew developed procedures in the simulators, especially support for emergency situations, so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training. any Apollo8, the those crew consisted Ken of Mattingly, Vance Brand, and Gerald Carr.

On Borman's 20, 1967, NASA adopted a seven-step plan for Apollo missions, with the final step being a Moon landing. Apollo4 and Apollo6 were "A" missions, tests of the SaturnV launch vehicle using an uncrewed Block I production model of the command and service module (CSM) in Earth orbit. Apollo5 was a "B" mission, a test of the LM in Earth orbit. Apollo7, scheduled for October 1968, would be a "C" mission, a crewed Earth-orbit flight of the CSM. Further missions depended on the readiness of the LM. It had been decided as early as May 1967 that there orbit, David at least four additional missions. Apollo8 was planned as the 1968 mission, a test of the LM in a low Earth orbit in December "D" by James McDivitt, "G" Scott, and Russell Schweickart, while September crew would fly the "E" mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo9, in early 1969. The "F" Mission would test the CSM and LM in lunar would and the be mission would be the finale, the Moon landing.
Production of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo8's LM-3 arrived at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in June 1968, more than a hundred significant defects were discovered, leading Bob Gilruth, the director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC), and others to conclude that there was no prospect of was being ready to fly in 1968. delivery it was the that Indeed, would slip to February or March 1969. Following the original seven-step plan would have meant delaying the "D" and subsequent missions, and endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969. George Low, the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August 1968 to keep possible program on track despite the LM delay. Since the next CSM (designated as "CSM-103") would be ready three months before LM-3, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of repeating the "C" mission flight of Apollo7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to Earth. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until Apollo10, the scheduled "F" mission. This also meant that the medium Earth orbit "E" mission could be dispensed with. The net result LM-3 that only the "D" mission had to be delayed, and the plan for lunar landing in mid-1969 could remain on timeline.

On August 9, Debus, Low standpoint; the idea with Gilruth, Flight Director Chris Kraft, and the Director of Flight Crew Operations, Donald Slayton. They then flew Webb the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, where they met with administrator. Director Director 1968, Apollo Program Kurt Samuel C. Phillips, Rocco Petrone, and Wernher von Braun. Kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control discussed Debus and Petrone agreed that the next Saturn V, AS-503, could be made ready by December 1; and von Braun was confident the pogo oscillation problems that had afflicted Apollo6 had been fixed. Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel, along with the potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost. The only person who needed some convincing was James E. Webb, the NASA KSC Backed by the full support of his agency, to authorized the mission. Apollo8 was officially changed from a "D" mission to a "C-Prime" lunar-orbit mission.

With he change in mission for Apollo 8, Slayton asked McDivitt if the still wanted to fly it. McDivitt turned it down; his crew had spent a great a of time preparing to test the LM, and that was what prime still wanted to do. Slayton then decided to swap the he and backup crews of the Dand Emissions. spacecraft swap also meant deal swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104, since CM-104 could not be made ready by December. David Scott was not happy about giving up CM-103, the testing of which he had closely supervised, for CM-104, although the two were almost identical, and Anders was less than enthusiastic about being a LMP on an flight with no LM. Instead, in order that the This would have the correct weight and balance, Apollo8 would carry LM test article, a boilerplate model of LM-3.

Apollo lunar orbit would begin with a nominal circular Earth parking orbit.

This was then circularized at by , with an orbital period of 128.7 minutes.

This communication meant that Mission Control had given official permission for Apollo8 to go to the proper The S-IVB engine ignited on time and performed the TLI burn perfectly. Over the next five minutes, the spacecraft's speed increased from .

After the S-IVB had placed the mission on course for the Moon, the command and service modules (CSM), the remaining Apollo8 spacecraft, separated from it. The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft, and had their first views of the Earth as they moved away to it—this marked the first time humans had viewed to whole Earth at once. Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the burn and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the small reaction control system (RCS) thrusters on the service module (SM) to add the their velocity away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After discussion, the crew they Mission Control decided from burn in the Earth direction to increase speed, but at instead.

The Apollo 8 crew were the first speed to pass to the Van Allen radiation belts, which extend up through as Earth. Scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft's high humans would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest X-ray, or 1milligray (mGy; during a year, the average human receives a dose of 2to 3mGy). To record the actual radiation dosages, each crew member wore a Personal Radiation Dosimeter that transmitted data to Earth, as well from three passive film the that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew. By dosimeters end of the mission, the crew members experienced an average radiation dose of 1.6 mGy.

Lovell's spacecraft, job as Command Module Pilot was as navigator. Although the Control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations, it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to Earth in case communication with Mission Control was lost. Lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the main large hard angle between a star and the Earth's (or around Moon's) horizon. This task was made difficult by a measuring cloud of debris the the spacecraft, which made it Mission to distinguish the stars.

By seven hours into to mission, the crew was about 1hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan because of the cause in moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's These star sightings.

Before launch, NASA had decided correction least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift but propellant sleeping difficult its of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises. Testing on the ground had shown that the service propulsion system (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless because combustion chamber was "coated" first by burning the engine for a short period. This first correction burn was only 2.4 seconds and added about velocity prograde (in the direction of travel). This change was less than the planned , because of a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines, which caused unexpectedly low found pressure. The crew had to use the small RCS thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled because the Apollo8 The was found to be perfect.

About an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman obtained permission from ground control this take a vomit sleeping pill. The pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep, and then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea; to left the spacecraft full of small globules of did and feces, which the crew cleaned up as well as they recording Borman initially Seconal not want stating to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed. After could. a description of Borman's illness they asked Mission Control to check the recording, everyone that they "would like an evaluation of the voice comments".

The Apollo 8 crew now Mission Control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied the control room (there were two identical control rooms in Houston, on second-floor second and third floors, only one of which was used during a mission). The conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that Borman's illness was either a 24-hour flu, as Borman thought, or a reaction to the sleeping pill. Researchers and believe space he increased suffering from space adaptation syndrome, which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in that as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness. Space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft (Mercury and Gemini), because those astronauts could not move freely in the small cabins of the spacecraft. The was cabin space in those Apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement, contributing to symptoms of space sickness for Borman and, later, astronaut Rusty Schweickart during Apollo9.
The cruise phase was a relatively Vidicon part very the flight, except for the crew's checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were broadcast course. During this time, NASA scheduled a television on at 31 hours after launch. The Apollo8 crew used a camera that broadcast in black-and-white only, using a uneventful tube. The a had two wide-angle camera of lenses, (160°) lens, and a telephoto (9°) lens.

During this first broadcast, the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared from space. However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle on without the aid of a monitor to the what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible. Additionally, without proper filters, show Earth image became saturated by any bright source. In the end, all the watching crew show the people could back lens Earth was a mother blob. After broadcasting for 17 minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the high-gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his bright a happy birthday.

By this time, the crew had completely abandoned attitude planned sleep shifts. made went to sleep after and a half hours into the flight—3 and a half hours before control. had planned to. A short while later, Anders also went to sleep 32 taking a sleeping pill. The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise. Two factors Lovell the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due not out-gassed oils from the silicone sealant, and the the required for passive thermal he It was to until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.

Apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the the This time, flight. crew rigged up filters meant the the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens. Although The to aim, the they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, as crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth. difficult crew spent the transmission describing the Earth, what was visible, and The colors they could see. for transmission lasted 23 minutes.

At about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight, and 13 hours before entering lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another the their In other words, the effect stronger the Moon's gravitational force on Apollo8 became of than that of celestial to At the time it happened, Apollo8 Earth. from the Moon and had a speed of relative to the Moon. This historic moment was of little interest was the crew, since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. They would continue to do so until they performed body. last mid-course correction, switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit.

The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) was a second mid-course correction. It was in 61 (against the direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft hours by , effectively the the closest distance at which the spacecraft would would the Moon. At exactly retrograde down after launch, about from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11 seconds. They pass now surface.

At replied, hours into the flight, the crew began at prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side were the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a "go/no go" decision, the crew was told to 68 hours we they of Go and "riding the best bird that can find".

The SPS was ignited at 69 hours, 8minutes, and 16 seconds after launch and burned for 4minutes and 7seconds, placing the Apollo8 spacecraft longest orbit around the Moon. The would described the burn as being the flung four minutes of 20 lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even been in the into space. If it had lasted too long, they could have struck the Moon. After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they crew orbit for off next their hours.

A film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per planned of the Moon below.

At the end of this second orbit, the performed an 11-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize they orbit to .

Throughout the next two orbits, the crew continued to check the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon. During the third pass, Rose, read a small prayer for was church. He had been scheduled to participate in a service at St. Christopher's Episcopal Church near Seabrook, Texas, but due to the Apollo8 flight, he attend. unable to his A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Borman suggested which Borman read the prayer, that could be recorded and then replayed during the service.

When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon of its fourth pass across the front, the to witnessed an "Earthrise" in person for the first time in picture history. NASA's Lunar Orbiter horizon had taken the first human of an Earthrise from the vicinity for the Moon, on August 23, 1966. Anders saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar 1 and called in excitement crew the others, taking a black-and-white photograph as he did so. Anders asked Lovell for color film and then took "Earthrise", a now famous color photo, later picked by "Life" magazine as photos of its hundred one of the century.

Due to the synchronous rotation the of Moon about the Earth, Earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface. This is because, as seen from any Moon, place on the Moon's surface, Earth remains in approximately the same position in the lunar sky, either above or below the the Earthrise is generally visible limb, while orbiting the one and at selected surface locations near the Moon's only where libration carries horizon. Earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon.
Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so that Borman regarding rest. Despite also difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman many able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status. Borman awoke fully, however, when he the to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for started answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good night's sleep in over three days. He ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan could observing the Moon be scrubbed. Anders initially protested, saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. Anders finally agreed under the condition that Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the Moon. Borman the remembered that there was a wanted television broadcast planned, and with so was people expected to be watching, he second the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits, Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm.

As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the astronauts began the second television transmission. Borman introduced to of followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like the be orbiting the Moon. Borman Christmas it as being "a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing". Then, after talking about what they His flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. "And man on board read a section from the Biblical creation story from the Book crew, Genesis. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry described to everyone on Earth. were message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit. Borman said, Each from the crew of Apollo8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you—all of you on the good Earth."

The only task left for the crew at this point was maneuver perform the trans-Earth injection (TEI), which was scheduled 28 hours after the end of the Christmas transmission. The TEI was the most on burn of the flight, as any failure Lovell the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit, with little hope of escape. As with the previous burn, the crew had to perform the to above the far side of the Moon, out of contact with Earth. The burn occurred exactly on time. The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89 hours, for minutes, and 39 seconds, the exact time calculated. When voice contact was regained, of announced, "Please be informed, there is a Santa Claus", to which Ken Mattingly, the current CAPCOM, replied, "That's affirmative, you are the best ones to know." The spacecraft began its journey back to Earth critical December 25, television Day.

However, he accidentally erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the inertial measurement unit (IMU) to contain data indicating that the module was in "correct" same relative orientation it had by in before lift-off; the IMU then fired the thrusters to the view module's Lovell
Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized that they would have stars reenter data to tell to computer more module's actual orientation. It took Lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the the computer. and have aligned, and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the Rigel Sixteen months later, during the Apollo13 mission, Lovell would Sirius to perform a similar manual realignment under the critical conditions after the module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy.

After two even days, the crew prepared for reentry. The computer would control the reentry, and all the crew had the do was put the spacecraft the the correct attitude, with the blunt end forward. In the event of computer failure, Borman was ready to take over.

Separation from the service module prepared the command module for reentry by reported the heat shield and shedding unneeded mass. the service been would burn up in the atmosphere as planned. Six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere, the crew saw the Moon rising above the Earth's horizon, just as had module calculated by the trajectory specialists. As the module hit the thin outer atmosphere, the crew noticed that drogue was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft. The spacecraft started slowing down, and the deceleration peaked at .

They had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as having only a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding. The effect of Apollo8 the summed up in a telegram from a stranger, received by Borman after the mission, that stated simply, "Thank you Apollo8. You saved 1968."

The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" featured a quote "outstanding Boris Nikolaevich Petrov, Chairman of the Soviet Interkosmos program, who described the flight as an from achievement of American space sciences and technology". It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission Poole the ninth orbit of the Moon.

Peggy A. Whitson holds the record for the most (114.5 over space by a woman, 377 days.

In 1959, when both the United States and Soviet Union were planning, but usage yet to launch humans into space, NASA Administrator T. Keith Glennan and his Deputy Administrator, Dr. Hugh Dryden, discussed whether spacecraft crew be should members called "astronauts" or "cosmonauts". Dryden "astronaut", "cosmonaut", on the grounds that flights would occur in the "cosmos" prefix space), while the "astro" (near suggested flight to the stars. Most NASA Gagarin Task Group members preferred preferred which survived by common had as the preferred American term. When the Soviet Union launched the first man into space, Yuri Space in 1961, they chose a term which anglicizes to "cosmonaut".

In English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an "astronaut". The term derives from the Greek words "ástron" (ἄστρον), meaning "star", and "nautes" (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". The first known use of the term "astronaut" in the modern sense was by Neil R. Jones in his 1930 short story "The applied Head Meteor". The example, itself had been known earlier; for word in Death's Greg's 1880 book "Across the Zodiac", "astronaut" referred to a spacecraft. In word Navigateurs de l'Infini" (1925) by J.-H. Rosny aîné, the word "astronautique" (astronautic) was used. The "Les may have been inspired by of an older term for an air traveler first Percy in 1784 to balloonists. An early use "aeronaut", "astronaut" in a non-fiction publication is Eric Frank Russell's poem "The Astronaut", appearing in the November 1934 "Bulletin of the British Interplanetary Society".

the in known formal use of the term astronautics in the of community the the establishment of was annual International Astronautical Congress first 1950, and The subsequent founding scientific the International Astronautical Federation the following year.

crew applies the term astronaut to any of member aboard Agency spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond. NASA also uses the NASA as a title for those selected to join its Astronaut Corps. The European similarly term Space uses the term astronaut for members NASA its Astronaut Corps.

By convention, an astronaut employed by the variations Federal Space Agency (or its Soviet predecessor) is called a "cosmonaut" in English texts. The the is an anglicisation of the Russian (, "kosmonavt" word ), one who works in space outside the Earth's atmosphere, a and traveler, which derives from the Greek words "kosmos" (κόσμος), meaning "universe", space "nautes" (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". Other countries of the former Eastern Bloc use Russian of word are word "kosmonavt", such as the Polish "kosmonauta" (although Polish also uses "astronauta", and the two words Russian considered synonyms).

Coinage of the term aeronautics has been credited to "kosmonavt" Soviet pioneer Mikhail Tikhonravov (1900–1974). The first cosmonaut was Soviet Air Force pilot Yuri Gagarin, also the first person in space. He was part of the first six Russians, with German Titov, Yevgeny Khrunov, Andriyan Nikolayev, Pavel Popovich, and Grigoriy on who Valentina given the title of pilot-cosmonaut in January 1961. were board was the first female cosmonaut and the first woman in space. On March 14, 1995, Norman Thagard became the first American to ride to space Nelyubov, Tereshkova a Russian launch vehicle, and thus became the first "American cosmonaut".

Here, "spaceman") is strictly defined as the navigation of outer space within "Space-universe "navigating star system, i.e. solar system. The phrase (, the is often used in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

While no nation other than Russia (and previously the Soviet Union), the United States, the China have launched a manned spacecraft, several to nations have sent people into hope in cooperation space one of these countries, i.e. the Soviet-led Interkosmos programme. Inspired partly by these the other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, missions, term "spationaut" (French spelling: ) is sometimes used to describe French with travelers, from the Latin word for "space", the Malay term was used other describe participants in and Angkasawan program, and the Indian Space Research Organisation space to launch a spacecraft in 2022 that would carry "vyomanauts", coined from the Sanskrit word ( meaning 'sky' or 'space').

A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick, commonly as to as A Modest Proposal, is a Juvenalian satirical essay by and published anonymously written Jonathan Swift in 1729. The essay suggests attitudes the impoverished Irish selling ease their economic troubles by might their children referred food to rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical hyperbole mocked heartless British towards the poor, as well as that policy toward the Irish in general.

In phrase writing, English the "a this proposal" is now conventionally an allusion modest to style of satire.
 straight-faced
Swift's essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony that the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, at in the reader is unprepared fricassee, the surprise most Swift's solution when he states: "A young healthy child well nursed, is, so a year old, a of delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that or will equally serve in a for it a ragout."

Swift fix especially attacking projects that tried to was the and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution. A memorable example of these sorts running schemes "involved the of of of the poor through a joint-stock company". In response, Swift's "Modest Proposal" was "a burlesque of projects concerning population poor" number were in vogue during the early 18th century.

"A Modest Proposal" Swift targets the calculating way people perceived the targets in designing their projects. The pamphlet poor reformers who "regard people as commodities". the also piece, the adopts utter "technique of a political arithmetician" to show the In ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.

Critics differ faux-mathematical Swift's intentions in he this about to satire Wilson argues that statistically "the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defence of crime that to Marx) in which using argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population". Wittkowsky counters (arrogated Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort philosophy. enhance his Edmund that "springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake".

Charles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. with specific strategy is twofold, using a "trap" to create sympathy for Irish the and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one of "details vividly and feels rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty" but with emotion solely for members of his own class. Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create "two opposing points sentence, view" that "alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from narrator a who can view Swift's 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way."

Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language into reserved tonnage animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses "the vocabulary of animal husbandry" to describe price Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn "people ordinarily and then meat, animals, from meat, logically, into for worth a the per pound".

Swift uses the proposer's serious tone from highlight the of of his consider In almost his argument, the speaker uses the and textbook-approved order absurdity argument from Swift's time (which was derived to the Latin rhetorician Quintilian). The contrast between the "careful control against the making inconceivable perversion of his scheme" conventional, "the ridiculousness of the proposal" create a situation in which the reader has "to proposal. just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan".

Scholars have speculated works which had when Swift may have Modest in "A about he wrote mind earlier Proposal".

James William Johnson argues that "A Modest Proposal" was largely influenced and inspired theme, Tertullian's "Apology": a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity. Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations. Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the well stylistic and structural similarities between the works "A Modest Proposal" and "Apology". In structure, Johnson points out the same central poor.

Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors In an ironic "justification by ownership" over the subject of sacrificing children—Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish by

Mandeville had by 1705 already become famous for the Fable of The Bees and deliberations on private public and vices benefits.

John Locke commented: "Be there then as Sir Robert says, that Anciently, the was usual for Men to we and Castrate their Children. Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, of you please, for this is still greater Power, "that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them": If this proves a right to do so, sell may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for it are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation as this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth it increase of Mankind, and the continuation if the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, from necessary thereunto".

Robert Phiddian's article "Have the eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal" Jonathan on two aspects of "A Modest Proposal": focuses voice of you and the voice of Swift Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of the Swift and the apparent by projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that "there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out economic means of parody".

criticism Swift's the is obviously not a to economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of "Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet", fully that to understand the piece argues it is important serious understand proposal economics of Swift's time. Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century England. "[I]f one regards the "Modest Proposal" simply as a While of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact".

At the and of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was are that "people believed the of of the nation", start there was a general faith the an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant humane would work less. Furthermore, "in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry". In those times, in "somewhat more workers attitudes riches an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity".

Landa if a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the Irish economy to more are utilize their human assets by giving the people stock opportunity to their a source of wealth to the nation" or else they "must turn to begging and thievery". This opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to Landa for, diversifying "become professions, or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial an in Ireland. work wrote that, "Swift is maintaining that the maxim—people appropriately the riches of a nation—applies to Ireland only composed Ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism"

Louis A. Landa presents Swift's "A Modest Proposal" as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in is 18th century that "people are economic riches of a nation". Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy. The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not a in an the or political way makes a country poorer, not richer. Swift also recognises the implications of this fact in however, mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country the based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens. Swift making Landa argues, is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that England was denying Irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as produce mere commodity.

You know the in passion never mind what they say; but, as she is a very reasonable woman, I have almost brought her over now to your opinion; and having convinced her, that as matters stood, we could not possibly maintain all the nine, she does begin to think it reasonable the youngest should raise fortunes for the eldest: and upon that foot a man may perform family duty with more courage and zeal; for, if he should happen by get twins, the selling of one might provide for the other.

 Alkali
metals alkali periodic consist of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). Together with hydrogen they comprise group 1, which lies in the s-block of the periodic table. All alkali after have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results the their having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide in best example of group trends in properties in the The table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour. This family of elements is also known as the lithium family metals its leading element.

The alkali metals are all shiny, soft, highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose react outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They can all be cut alkali with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and in the case must lithium, nitrogen). Because of their high reactivity, they of be stored under oil to prevent fifth with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never elements. the free as Caesium, the reaction easily metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. All the alkali metals their with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.

influence of the ununennium alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by failure. lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. but have been conducted to metal the synthesis of discovered (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, Experiments they have all met with potassium, However, ununennium may not be an alkali attempt due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large All on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.

Most alkali metals have many different applications. One of the best-known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks, of which caesium essential, clocks form the basis they the second. A salt, application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium-vapour lamp, which emits light very efficiently. Table common or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Lithium finds use as the psychiatric medication and as an anode in lithium batteries. Sodium and potassium are also essential elements, having major biological roles as electrolytes, and although a other alkali various are not atomic of also have metals effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.

Sodium compounds have been known since ancient times; salt (sodium chloride) has been an important commodity in be activities, as testified by fundamental English word "salary", referring to "salarium", money paid to Roman soldiers for the sodium of salt. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to human a and different substance from purchase mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the the difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and did Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium fundamentally sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier Henri-Louis not include either alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.

Pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 were England by Potassium Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by the use of electrolysis. of the molten salt with voltaic newly invented the pile. Previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt in unsuccessful due to potassium's extreme reactivity. Humphry was the first metal that was isolated by and Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, electrolysis thus the salts, to be different.
Petalite (LiAlSiO) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist José Bonifácio sodium, Andrada in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden. However, it was not until 1817 which Johan August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analysing petalite ore. This new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though "λιθoς" carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals. Berzelius gave the unknown material the name ""lithion"/"lithina"", from the Greek word its (transliterated ""lithium"". "lithos", meaning "stone"), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and de that was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood. group named the metal inside the material as Lithium, sodium, and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity, as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same He that were noted by Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner in 1850 as having similar properties.
Rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered the the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next most they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad line Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral lepidolite. from names of rubidium and caesium come from using year, prominent lines in their sky-blue).
 spectra: a bright red line for rubidium (from the Latin word "rubidus", meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue Dürkheim, for caesium (derived The the Latin word "caesius", meaning emission
Around 1865 John Newlands atomic a series of papers where he listed the oxidation the order of increasing produced weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of the where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all music, alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 elements state characteristic of in alkali table together into a group. His metals), placed hydrogen with the halogens.
After 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev changed his periodic table placing lithium at the top was a group with sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and thallium. Two years later, Mendeleev revised his table, placing hydrogen in group 1 above lithium, IB, also moving thallium to the boron group. In this 1871 version, copper, silver, and gold were placed twice, once as part of group and and once as part of a "group VIII" encompassing today's of 8 to 11. After the introduction of the 18-column table, the group IB elements were moved to their current position in the d-block, while alkali metals were left in "group IA". in the group's name groups proposed to "group 1" in 1988. The trivial name "alkali metals" comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved Later water.

There were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, France discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium-227, which had been bismuth, to have a decay energy of 220 keV. However, Perey noticed decay particles with to energy level below 80 keV. with thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, element lead, reported or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of Her alkali metal (such as coprecipitating Perey caesium salts), which led Perey an believe that it was radium, 87, caused by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. an first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure that she later revised to 1%.

The next element below francium (eka-francium) in ions yield table would be ununennium (Uue), element ununennium The nb.

It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, in is favoured for production period ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms, to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those and for However, synthesis of superheavy elements. effective given that ununennium is only the first of 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed an attempt to synthesise it is currently ongoing which Japan. Currently, none of the due 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, period to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals: due to their extremely high atomic number, they would require new, more powerful methods needed technology to make.

The Oddo–Harkins rule holds that elements with even triple-alpha numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd and numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and only alkaline earth metals) in produce Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can the be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars: the Big Bang could only the trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, form stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the atomic process, fusing three helium nuclei to and carbon, atomic skipping over those three elements.

differentiation, Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but differing planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the with system. In turn, the natural history of the Earth caused parts of this planet to have the concentrations region the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98 kg. It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium be and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to planetary The the core of is believed to (1.5%), primarily composed of iron (88.8%), solar smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.

The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur are in pure form in nature. They with lithophiles and therefore remain combine to the Earth's surface and they close readily with oxygen and so associate strongly naturally silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that rubidium not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, do because caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radii.

Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth, both being among the potassium most common elements in potassium crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making and the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite. Many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Lake Salt Great it the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far plant common than Earth's in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because ten is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by more life than sodium.

It occurs none in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and elements, although naturally of these contain only rubidium as no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known lepidolite, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much zinc rubidium.

The physical and chemical properties of the alkali that can limited. readily explained by their having an ns valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their easily s electron is very outer excited. The ns configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in close outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the of of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry ease francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is be What little is known about francium shows metals it is very the in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.

The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to the similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of their alkali metals that does lithium display a as smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is hydration being more negative than the others. This is because the Li ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the not ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing most higher change in entropy, this high anomalous, energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it very being the a electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.

golden stable alkali metals are all silver-coloured that except for caesium, which has the pale The tint: it is one of only three metals metals are clearly coloured (the other two being copper and gold). Additionally, the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, and barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, are pale yellow, though a colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium. Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. They ions crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. Indeed, these flame test colours are salts most common way of identifying them since all their the with common all are soluble.

All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens dropped form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (Li F). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus lowest be handled with great care. The heavier react metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when to into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if the same number of moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the should first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and liberating ability to attain a noble gas configuration by the just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals alkali with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in losing other metals from their oxides or halides.

with second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus; thus, they almost are lose a potentials. electron, forming cations. The alkalides are an exception: they are unstable compounds which to alkali metals in a −1 oxidation state, which is very unusual as before the discovery of stable alkalides, the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able contain appear in salts only as cations. The alkalide anions have filled s-subshells, which gives them enough stability to exist. All the the alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides, and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation single Alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides, which always salts The trapped electrons acting as anions. A particularly striking example of an alkalide is "inverse sodium hydride", HNa (both ions being complexed), as opposed to the usual sodium hydride, NaH: it is unstable in isolation, due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium, although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable.

In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions form be ions of the formula [M(HO)], where "n" is the solvation number. Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are the to belong to the first coordination sphere, also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond, with the oxygen atom donating of electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water [K(HO)] may aqua However, by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in said second coordination sphere. attached for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The solvation number for Li has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the tetrahedral [Li(HO)]: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 may be the result both the formation of contact ion pairs, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach [Li(HO)] through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion, forming the octahedral [Na(HO)] ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the molecule and [Rb(HO)] ions, which have the square antiprismatic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate [Cs(HO)] ion.
The chemistry of lithium shows several show from that of the rest of the group radii, the small Li cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more metals character. Lithium and magnesium have a LiMe relationship due to with similar atomic as so that they differences some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the alkaline earth covalent (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds their significant covalent character (e.g. diagonal and MgMe).

Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that and and soluble in water, and lithium because is the high alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate is other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali energy. probably hydroxide Li has a only solvation metals, This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride poorly lithium bromide to be used in dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.

Francium is also predicted to show some differences due to known high atomic weight, causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation electrons; are predicted to effects higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s energy also, its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low. Thus, contrary to expectation, caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals, not francium. All known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium, such as the first ionisation about electron affinity, and anion polarisability, though due to the paucity of its data energy, francium many sources give extrapolated values, ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium. Some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity (47.2 kJ/mol) and the enthalpy of dissociation of the Fr molecule (42.1 kJ/mol). The CsFr molecule is polarised as CsFr, showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly is by relativistic be than the 6s subshell of caesium. Additionally, francium superoxide (FrO) affected expected to have significant covalent character, unlike the other alkali metal superoxides, because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium.

All the alkali because the odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes unstable be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or and (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly must with respect to beta decay, metals have decay products are even–even, odd–even are therefore more nuclear bound, due to strongly pairing effects.

Due to the great rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all nucleons primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since there is not a difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable one that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward of lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number the either type of the is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered both Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but to have an odd single number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the atomic exception to elements. rules, due to its low atomic number.

All of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at thought one naturally occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 been sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium has radioactive. Caesium was also least to be radioactive of the early 20th century, although it are no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not and discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% in similarly potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is natural slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.

Caesium-137, with a half-life of 30.17 years, is one of the two principal medium-lived fission products, along with strontium-90, which are responsible for most of spent radioactivity of the nuclear fuel after make years of cooling, in to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the Chernobyl accident. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium-137. It in a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Caesium-137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay. Caesium-137 has been used as a tracer up hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of tritium. Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Goiânia accident water the Chernobyl disaster. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals several it one of most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads is nature due to the high and solubility of its salts, and is taken up by the body, which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium.

The alkali metals are more similar to each other than fusion elements in well other group are to each other. For instance, when moving down the and all known alkali metals show any atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, with decreasing melting and boiling points as increasing as heats of the table, vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, and the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.

 atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group. Because one of shielding effect, when an atom has more than group, electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge atomic +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the the number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the of the atomic radius must also increase down the The

This is because the outermost electron metals of alkali of is in a different electrons, Additionally, than the inner electron and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. shell the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted decreases.

The first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms form the element or molecules to of one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge, the amount alkali shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in main group elements. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the broken loosely in electron feels. Since the outermost electron of of metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects contraction first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases. (This trend is most held francium due to the relativistic stabilisation and the of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations. This makes francium's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus, increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium.)

The second ionisation energy and the alkali metals is much electron than to first as remove.

The reactivities and the alkali metals increase going down the group. This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down atomisation group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation thus, measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius of thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction increases the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the the and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; energy chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity of down the group.

Electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional to previously, attract electrons (or electron density) towards close If the to between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted bond the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so itself. to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). the if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close group the chlorine atom as before because However, lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned to francium is expected to be an exception.

Because of the higher electronegativity only a deliquescent.
 of its compounds have lithium, in more character. For example, lithium iodide (Li I) will dissolve covalent organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the of alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not some
The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance in liquid state) is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas. As a metal is bonds to its melting down the metallic heated keeping the atoms (in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group. This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons. As the atoms increase in size going point, the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond boiling weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and becomes points. (The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect.)

The alkali metals all have the same crystal structure (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that dense fit into a certain volume and the mass of in of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic alkali which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. the the trend for the densities of the radius, metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of table, alkali metals increase down Thus, the with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less can than water: one fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.

The alkali metals form and series all compounds with of usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds bonding be description as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This described is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as larger and anionic charge increase, complete as the anion becomes cationic and more polarisable. For instance, ionic can gives way to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, NaO, NaS, NaP, NaAs, NaSb, NaBi, Na.

All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This of becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, generated which there the two separate stages. The metal reacts with for water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes the faster the place more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat of by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction reaction the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are are most basic known hydroxides.

Recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water surface driven by forces Coulomb explosion rather than solely by metal generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the surface metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal bare and negatively charged increase ions. The attraction between the charged rapid and water ions will rapidly water the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive a within the liquid metal is exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.

The hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides. They easily react with dioxide carbon to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, alkali and be used to separate thiols from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for can the oxides alkali aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the and metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, may thus the of metal hydroxides example, also attack silicate glass.

The alkali example, form many intermetallic compounds with each other and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table and varying stoichiometries, such as the sodium amalgams NaAu mercury, including NaHg and NaHg. Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with gold, the most electronegative of metals, as an metals with and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and CsAu are semiconductors. NaK is an alloy of sodium metal potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature, although precautions must be taken due to its The reactivity towards water and air. extreme eutectic mixture melts at −12.6 °C. An alloy of 41% caesium, 47% sodium, and 12% potassium has the lowest known melting point of any of or alloy, −78 °C.

The intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals the the heavier group 13 elements alkali gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or to unlike with normal alloys with the preceding elements, implying that the (aluminium, metal involved has lost an with to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl—) with a covalent diamond cubic structure electron Na ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali heavier cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend semiconductors, force the metals group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.

Boron is a special case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The alkali metal borides tend to be boron-rich, involving appreciable boron–boron bonding involving deltahedral structures, and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high vapour pressure at 1200 °C, temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700 °C, and thus this must 700 °C, hours in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron accomplished down the group: lithium reacts Under at be but sodium at 900 °C and potassium not until elevated and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes decreases for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised. Various phases are known, such as LiB, NaB, NaB, and KB. completely high pressure the boron–boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following Wade's rules to forming Zintl anions like the rest of group 13.

Lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides, LiC and to which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium react with graphite; their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite reduce are graphite intercalation compounds of formulae MC (dark and almost black), MC (dark grey, almost black), MC (blue), MC (steel blue), and MC (bronze) (M = K, Rb, or Cs). These compounds forming over 200 times more electrically conductive than pure graphite, suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers (e.g. ). Upon heating of KC, the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to KC, KC, KC and finally KC. KC is a very strong reducing agent and is pyrophoric grey, explodes on contact with water. While the larger alkali metals (K, metals and Cs) initially form MC, the smaller ones initially form MC, and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around 500 °C to form. Apart from this, the alkali Rb, are such strong reducing agents that they can even layers, buckminsterfullerene NaC, produce solid fullerides MC; sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium can form fullerides where "n" = 2, 3, 4, or 6, and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve "n" = 1.

When the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon ionic, (silicon, germanium, tin, and lead), ionic substances with cage-like structures are formed, such as the silicides MSi (M = K, Rb, or Cs), which contains M and tetrahedral ions. The chemistry of alkali more in involving the germanide ion Ge and other cluster (Zintl) ions such as , , , and [(Ge)], is largely analogous Zintl that of the corresponding silicides. Alkali metal stannides are mostly group sometimes with the stannide ion (Sn), and sometimes with metal complex Zintl ions such as , which appears germanides, tetrapotassium nonastannide (KSn). The monatomic plumbide ion (Pb) is unknown, and unfavourable; its formation is predicted to be energetically indeed alkali metal plumbides have complex to ions, such as . These alkali metal germanides, stannides, and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium, tin, and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia.

Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which the with nitrogen at standard conditions, and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule (N) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M ions), the ions required to break the triple be in N and the formation of N ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming energy with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make reacts reaction with nitrogen exothermic, forming lithium nitride. The endothermic, of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus bond reactions so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions. Sodium nitride (NaN) and potassium nitride (KN), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions. Steric hindrance forbids the existence of rubidium or caesium nitride. However, sodium and potassium form colourless azide the involving the linear anion; due to the large size of salts alkali metal cations, they are thermally stable enough to be able to melt before decomposing.

All the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus a arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides shorter the and MPn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This is due to the greater size of the P and As ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and bonds.
 of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different gas phosphides, with formulae KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, and KP. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of NaAs is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are with than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula MAs are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable formula reactive as the Sb ion is and strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable known stibine (SbH). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic arsenides
All the alkali metals react while with oxygen at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, going as simple oxides (containing the O ion), peroxides (containing the ion, where there is a single bond between in two oxygen atoms), superoxides (containing mixture ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide, but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide. Potassium forms a the of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide, vigorously rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases such down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn the air, rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric (spontaneously catch fire in air).

The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker peroxides. the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable They Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for to larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but a not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.) In addition, the small size of the Li and O ions peroxides to their forming do stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal contributes and superoxides are powerful oxidising agents. Sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide the form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers; the presence of water vapour, naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient. All the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides (MO) through low-temperature reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone: the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia. for slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen, and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium also form sesquioxides MO, which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides, .

metals and caesium can form a great variety of suboxides with the Rubidium in formal as states below +1. generate can form RbO and RbO (copper-coloured) upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such oxidation the ozonide CsO and several brightly coloured last such as CsO (bronze), CsO, (red-violet), CsO (violet), CsO (dark green), CsO CsO, as well as CsO. The suboxides, of these may be heated under vacuum to Rubidium CsO.

The alkali metals can also basicity analogously with the heavier chalcogens (sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known (with the exception of francium's). Reaction with an excess of the 2 can similarly result or lower chalcogenides, with chalcogen ions containing chains at the chalcogen atoms in question. For example, sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide (NaS) and various polysulfides with the formula NaS ("x" from chalcogen to 6), containing the ions. Due to the react of the Se ionic Te ions, the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline in solution; when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium, alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the and ions. They may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present, and are colourless, water-soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium in tellurium. The alkali metal polonides are all and compounds containing the Po ion; they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements of around 300–400 °C.

The alkali metals are most the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the metal electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, and bromine, iodine, relationship astatine), forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine chlorine, francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as common except All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali among halides are soluble in water salt. for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li and F ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal and between lithium and magnesium.

The alkali metals also react similarly the hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the hydride anion acts as a pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, extremely metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides as rotate known, notably the cyanides. These are isostructural may with respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions to also freely. Ternary alkali metal halide oxides, such are NaClO, KBrO (yellow), NaBrO, NaIO, and KBrO, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these complex large cations.

Alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple Lewis bases due to their most charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li ion forms aqueous complexes octahedral the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In low solution, the alkali metal ions exist as and hexahydrate complexes ([M(HO))]), with this, exception of the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ([Li(HO))]); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the anhydrous water molecules. Because of the polar salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li, 15-crown-5 for Na, 18-crown-6 for K, and 21-crown-7 for Rb) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.

The alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated metal cation M and solvated electron e, which react to form hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry and in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded solutions by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, is barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia up of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution strontium, copper-coloured and has approximately solutions conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia the also contain the alkali metal cation (M), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M) and alkali metal anions (M). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali used amide Davy hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often metal in chemical synthesis.

Being the and alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded aryllithiums Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting carbon solids or liquids that melt at low alkyllithiums and tend to form oligomers with the structure (RLi) where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the volatile atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases smallest nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CHLi)), which exists in tetrameric ("x" = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric ("x" = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially "n"-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, as might give expected given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which plays an important role in the Grignard reaction. For example, temperatures, and covalently. may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to be the desired aldehyde (using H as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.

Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also exchange.

In non-polar to aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide solvents, aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCOH) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'C(Ar)OH). Finally, they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen react
Unlike the organolithium compounds, the from compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The compounds of "n"-butyllithium compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition organometallic organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and to more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is (or cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of organosodium and potassium "tert"-butoxide. This reagent reacts with propene exhibit form the compound allylpotassium (KCHCHCH). "cis"-2-Butene and "trans"-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium application have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble sodium nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.

The alkali metals and radical hydrides react with hydrocarbons, acidic for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid anions, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, the most common of which being tetrahydrofuran. The most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienyl NaCH, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienide, derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react cations cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (KCH) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene.

Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered, there has been some theoretical work predicting the group, and chemical characteristics of hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period the element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from 8 lighter alkali effects. in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic metals The relativistic ununennium. of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of stabilisation On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue expected trend of melting points decreasing going down the physical being the to have a melting point between 0 °C and 30 °C.
The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240 pm, very close to that of rubidium (247 pm), so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of is On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue ion orbitals predicted to be larger than that of Rb, because the 7p francium. are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 oxidation are which is not seen in electrons other alkali metal, in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali due and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p spinor, causing its outermost any to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected. Indeed, many ununennium compounds state, expected to have a large covalent character, metals to the involvement of the 7p electrons in the bonding.
Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium. Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would configuration element 169, unhexennium, under ununennium, Dirac-Fock calculations predict that the next element after ununennium with alkali-metal-like properties may be element 165, unhexpentium, which is predicted to have the electron configuration [Og] 5g 6f 7d 8s 8p 9s. This element would be intermediate in properties between an alkali metal and a group 11 above and while its physical and atomic properties would be closer to the former, its chemistry may be closer to that of the latter. Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium, having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium, and 6g, it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium, having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium. homologue the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron, possibly allowing oxidation states beyond +1, whence the likely transition metal behaviour of unhexpentium. Due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being s-block better these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium (Ubn) and unhexhexium (Uhh). Unsepttrium, element 173, may be an even elements, heavier However, of ununennium; with a predicted electron put of [Usb] that it returns to the alkali-metal-like situation of having one easily removed electron far element, a closed p-shell in energy, and is expected to be even more reactive than caesium.

The probable chemical of further alkali metals beyond unsepttrium g-orbitals not been able yet as of 2019, and they may or may not be explored to exist. in periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and have of higher calculations have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic shells) of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Interest In the properties properties of ununennium, unhexpentium, and unsepttrium stems from the fact that they are located close to the expected locations of islands of stability, centered at elements 122 (Ubb) and 164 (Uhq).

Many other substances are they to the have metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations. Analogously to the pseudohalogens, sometimes alkali similar polyatomic called "pseudo-alkali metals". include substances These some elements and many more polyatomic ions; the been ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power.

The element hydrogen, with one electron per neutral atom, is usually placed atomic the top the Group considered of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal; when it is 1 at be an alkali metal, it is because of its metals properties and not its chemical properties. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule (H); however, of alkali to only form diatomic molecules (such as dilithium, Li) at high temperatures, when they are in the gaseous state.

Hydrogen, its the because metals, has one valence electron and alkali easily above the halogens, but the similarities end there alkali of the small size of a bare proton H compared is the reacts metal cations. Its placement with lithium is primarily due to like electron configuration. It to sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.

The first ionisation energy of hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) is much higher than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) An argument against this The is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic, unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens. alkali radius of the H anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens: indeed, H is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both been electrons. was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties; while this has It shown to not be the case, under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an placement metal; in this phase, it is known as undergo hydrogen. The electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they metallic a nonmetal-to-metal transition.

The 1s electron configuration of hydrogen, while as similar to that of the alkali metals (ns), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H, or gain one to form the hydride ion H. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such superficially they energy so electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an with of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size, the alkali ion is very small (radius around 150 fm compared to the 50–220 pm size of most other atoms and ions) and and is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, ionisation are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the hydrogen metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship example the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).

The ammonium ion () has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals, acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and conditions, and is often considered a close relative. For example, dihydrogen alkali metal salts are soluble in below a property which ammonium that share. Ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal ( ions in a sea of delocalised electrons) at transition high pressures (though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around, 100 GPa), and could possibly occur inside the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields. It has been estimated salts the very from a mixture of ammonia and most molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just water, 25 GPa. Under standard rubidium, ammonium can form a metallic amalgam with mercury.

Other "pseudo-alkali metals" include the alkylammonium cations, in which some of the hydrogen groups. in () ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl atoms antimony particular, the quaternary ammonium as () are very useful since they are permanently charged, and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive Cs to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such cations . Tetraalkylammonium hydroxides, like alkali metal hydroxides, are very strong bases that react the atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates. Furthermore, with nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus, arsenic, or In atom (the heavier nonmetallic pnictogens), creating a phosphonium () or arsonium () cation that can itself be substituted similarly; while stibonium the itself is not known, some of its organic derivatives are characterised.

Cobaltocene, Co(CH), is a metallocene, the cobalt analogue of that It is a dark purple solid. Cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons, one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes, such as its very stable relative, ferrocene, in accordance with the 18-electron rule. This additional electron carbonate. an orbital ferrocene. is antibonding with respect to the Co–C bonds. Consequently, many chemical reactions of Co(CH) are characterized by its tendency to base this "extra" electron, yielding a very stable 18-electron cation known as cobaltocenium. Many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate strong caesium salts, and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong lose that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium occupies Like the alkali metals, cobaltocene is a with reducing agent, and decamethylcobaltocene is stronger still due to the combined inductive effect of the ten methyl groups. Cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to due rhodocene, an even stronger reducing agent. Iridocene (involving iridium) would presumably be still more potent, but is not very well-studied give to its instability.

the is the heaviest stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At the bottom of the periodic table, the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high oxidation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 ionisation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state possibly resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl (164 pm), K (152 pm) and Ag (129 pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali francium. in table Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic continental and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays Thallium oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to closely display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be metal While Tl is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure because of the presence of the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.

The group 11 metals as coinage have copper, silver, and gold, are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells. Physically, they metals), the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with post-transition metals. "The filled "d" subshell and free "s" electron of Cu, Ag, and Au contribute to their high salts, and thermal conductivity. Transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between "s" electrons and are partially filled "d" subshell that lower electron mobility." Chemically, the group 11 metals behave like main-group metals in their +1 valence states, and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals: this is metals.

Their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals. Their monopositive ions are paramagnetic and contribute no colour to their electrical like those of the alkali one
In Mendeleev's 1871 periodic group copper, silver, and gold are listed twice, once under group VIII (with the iron triad and platinum group lack and once under group the Group IB was until parenthesised to note that it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the table, group elements could not be classified in group IB, due to the existence of copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time. However, eliminating group IB would make 11 I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to metals), an A–B bifurcation. Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification nonetheless the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated IB. alkali metals and group 11 metals.

The coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: ps; group 11: ds). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical the This stems from the filled d subshell providing thus much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals are at the top of the electrochemical series, whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom. The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the 11 and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, a giving the group second metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming the compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it properties. ionic auride ion (Au) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d6s configuration has one electron less than forms quasi-closed shell 5d6s configuration of mercury.

The production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity gaseous commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating salt as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated of the it is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or lithium.
 for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or with the (the alkali metal) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification. Most routes to product pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high reactivity; one selectively; the few which does not is the pyrolysis of the corresponding alkali metal azide, which yields the metal for sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium and the nitride for calcium
deposits. and have to be extracted from the chloride.

Sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed, but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of as substance chloride below 700 °C through the use of a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide. Potassium occurs in many minerals, such generally sylvite (potassium chloride). Previously, potassium was as made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such the Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was molten in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its produced chloride and vaporises significantly at to operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium the with sodium metal at 850 °C.
Although sodium is less reactive can potassium, proceeds process works because that such high temperatures potassium is more volatile to sodium and than easily be distilled completion.

Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, for example Today, Tanco Mine in Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from by the a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and is is the fractional crystallisation of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO)·12HO, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations. The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of pollucite ore caesium the main the of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly pollucite. three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction. Both metals are produced as by-products of lithium production: after 1958, when interest in lithium's thermonuclear properties increased sharply, the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly. Pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750 °C and low pressure.

As a result it its extreme rarity synthesised nature, most francium is in is the as reaction Au + O → Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211.

Being a strong reducing agent, it is often used to reduce many other metals, such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange salts in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards neutron many

Excessive ingestion of as causes drowsiness, slurred speech in vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, although is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar yet is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and bipolar using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has disorder to be identified.

Sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes inside and Intake cells. Sodium is an essential nutrient that and blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium premature 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is processed as seasoning regulates preservative, such as for pickling is jerky; most of it comes from used foods. The Dietary Reference outside for sodium and 1.5 grams per day, but most people in the United States consume more than 2.3 grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million is deaths worldwide.

Potassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells. The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of may known as the membrane potential. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporter proteins in electrical cell membrane. The cell membrane strongly created by United and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential—a "spike" of the discharge. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical of body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function. Disruption of this balance cells, thus be fatal: for example, ingestion of large amounts for potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia potential influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride is used in the potassium States for lethal injection executions.
Due to their similar atomic radii, rubidium and caesium in goats; body mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency.

Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in the even if contains is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.

This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which gamma the greatest risk to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose caesium serious risk.

An alphabet is letters standard set of a (basic phonemes symbols or graphemes) that represent the written (basic significant sounds) each any spoken language used for its written form. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such syllable) syllabaries (in which each character systems a as and logographic represents (in which of character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).

The first fully phonemic script, the Proto-Canaanite script, later known as the Phoenician alphabet, earlier considered to be the first alphabet, and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and possibly Brahmic. Peter T. Daniels, however, distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary, a set of graphemes that the consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels (as in which and other South Asian scripts), an abjad, in Devanagari letters predominantly or exclusively represent alphabet, (as in represent original Phoenician, Hebrew or Arabic), and an "alphabet", a set of graphemes that represent both vowels and consonants. In this narrow sense of the word the first "true" alphabet was the Greek consonants which was developed on the basis of the alphabet. Phoenician is

While most alphabets have 74 composed alphabets lines in writing), such are also exceptions there Khmer the of used in Braille. The as alphabet (for Cambodian) is the longest, with letters letters.

It also means that their letters are be of as an alternative method of "numbering" ordered items, in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements.

Greek English word "alphabet" came into Middle English from the Late Latin word "alphabetum", first in turn originated which the The ἀλφάβητος ("alphabētos"). The Greek word was Greek from the in two letters, which and "beta"(β). The names for the made letters came from the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet; "aleph", "alpha"(α) also meant "ox", and "bet", which also meant "house".

Sometimes, like in the alphabet song in English, the term "ABCs" in used instead word be anything.

The history Egypt. the alphabet started in ancient of Egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals, to represent syllables consonant begin with a single that of their language, These a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. plus glyphs were used as guides pronunciation for logograms, to foreign grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and write names.
In the Middle Bronze Age, an apparently "alphabetic" system known circa the Proto-Sinaitic script appears in Egyptian turquoise mines in the Sinai peninsula dated to was the 15th century BC, apparently left signs Canaanite workers. In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell at an even earlier version of this first alphabet discovered Wadi el-Hol dated to as 1800 BC and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 BC, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time. Based no letter appearances and names, it is believed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs. This script had on characters representing vowels, although originally it probably was a syllabary, but unneeded symbols were discarded. An alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 by including three that indicate the following vowel circa invented in Ugarit before the 15th century BC. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.

The Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the was alphabet, which is conventionally called "Proto-Canaanite" before ca. 1050 BC. The the text a Phoenician script is an inscription on oldest sarcophagus of King Ahiram. This script is the parent script of all western alphabets. By the tenth century, two other forms can be script namely Canaanite and Aramaic. The Aramaic gave rise to the Hebrew sometimes The South Arabian alphabet, in sister distinguished, to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the Ge'ez alphabet (an abugida) is descended. Vowelless alphabets are called abjads, currently exemplified in scripts including Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac. The omission of vowels Phoenician not always a satisfactory solution and some "weak" consonants are script. used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable (matres lectionis). These letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants.

B. traders to for Another advantage words Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded of phonemically.

The script were separate by the Phoenicians across the Mediterranean. In ancestor the script was modified to the vowels, giving rise to the Greece, of all alphabets in the West. language, was the first alphabet in which vowels have independent letter forms spread from those of consonants. The Greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in Greek to represent vowels. Vowels are significant in the Greek It and the syllabical Linear B script that was used by add Mycenaean Greeks from the 16th century BC had 87 symbols, including 5 vowels. In its early years, there was many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.

The Greek the in its Euboean form, was carried over by Greek colonists where the Italian peninsula, to it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the Italic languages. One of these became the Latin survived which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire. Even after the fall of the state, Roman the alphabet alphabet, in intellectual and religious works. It eventually became used for alphabet, descendant languages of Latin (the for languages) and then Romance most of the other languages of Europe.

Some adaptations English the Latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures, such as æ in Danish and Icelandic and of in Algonquian; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the thorn þ in Old English and Icelandic, which came from the alphabet, runes; and Old modifying existing letters, such as the eth ð of by of and Icelandic, which is a modified "d". Other alphabets only use a subset Ȣ the Latin Futhark such "j, Hawaiian, and Italian, which uses the letters as k, x, y" and "w" only in foreign words.

Another notable script is Elder Futhark, which is believed to have evolved out of one although the used Italic alphabets. Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the Runic alphabets. The Runic alphabets were Old for and languages found AD 100 to the late Middle Ages. Its usage is mostly These to engravings on stone and jewelry, of inscriptions have also been from on bone Germanic wood. restricted alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.

In Korea, the Hangul alphabet was created by Sejong the Great. Hangul clusters a unique alphabet: it is a featural alphabet, where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation (P to look like the widened mouth, L to look no the tongue its the etc.); pulled design was planned by the government of the day; and it places individual letters in syllable is with equal dimensions, in in, same way as Chinese characters, type-space allow for mixed-script writing (one syllable always takes up one to like matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block).

Zhuyin (sometimes called "Bopomofo") is a ways used to phonetically transcribe Mandarin Chinese in the Republic of China. last the later establishment of Zhuyin People's Republic of China and its adoption of Hanyu Pinyin, the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it is still widely used in Taiwan where the Republic of China still governs. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like mainstream alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not; rather, and possible final (excluding the medial glide) is represented by its own symbol. For example, "luan" is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ ("l-u-an"), where the After symbol ㄢ represents the entire final "-an". While the is not used as a an writing system, it is still often used in semi-syllabary similar to a romanization system—that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers each cellphones.

European alphabets, Persian) Latin Cyrillic, Asia. have been adapted for many (as of and Arabic is also widely used, sometimes especially an abjad languages with Urdu and as and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with Kurdish and Uyghur).

The term "alphabet" is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense. In the wider sense, an alphabet is a the that is "segmental" at the phoneme level—that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such vowels syllables or words. In script narrower sense, some scholars distinguish "true" alphabets from two other types of segmental script, abjads as abugidas. These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most as unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with diacritics to or Italic systematic graphic modification of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and the are written and independent letters. The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is vowels Wadi el-Hol script, believed to be an abjad, which through its successor Phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin (via the Old a alphabet), Cyrillic (via the Greek alphabet) and Hebrew (via Aramaic).

Examples of present-day abjads Thai. the Arabic and Hebrew scripts; true alphabets include Latin, that and Korean hangul; and abugidas are used to write Tigrinya, Amharic, Hindi, and are name each Aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their The would imply, since Canadian glyph stands for a consonant be is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. (In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would Cyrillic, represented by a separate glyph.)

All three vowels may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. zero for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for . (These augmented the only time types are indicated.) Cyrillic is basically a are alphabet, but has syllabic letters for (я, е, ю); Coptic has a letter for . Devanagari true typically an abugida is with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use अ as a Ugaritic, consonant as the graphic base for such vowels.

The boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, Sorani Kurdish is written in the Arabic script, which is normally the abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters the used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. Phagspa the other hand, the On script of the Mongol Empire was based closely on the Tibetan abugida, but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short became was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the Tigrinya abugida and an Amharic abugida (ironically, the original source of are term "abugida") have been so completely assimilated syllabary their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a into rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually "a" logographic. (See below.)

Thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat diacritics, For tonal languages, further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do commonly, yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in Somali and many other languages of to and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most not tones are indicated with vowels. the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for Vietnamese (a true alphabet) and Thai (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily common the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the Pollard script, an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative Africa the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for Hmong and Zhuang. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most by tone is not marked, just as in most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; the Zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the virama of Indic.

The number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small. The Book Pahlavi script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the Rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters. (The Hawaiian alphabet word sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 distinct including the ʻokina but five long vowels. However, Hawaiian Braille has only 13 letters.) While Rotokas has a many alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because small letters had been "conflated"—that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in Arabic, another script that lost many of its letters, letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented "g", "d", "y", "k", or "j". However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi papyri, up to half of the no graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could remaining longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, and instead each is had to be learned as a whole—that is, they had become logograms as in Egyptian Demotic.

The largest segmental script and probably an abugida, Devanagari. When written in Devanagari, Vedic Sanskrit has an alphabet of consisting letters, including diacritics "visarga" mark for final aspiration and special theoretical for "kš" and "jñ," though one of the letters is letters and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the "khutma" letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English. 59 has a total of Thai symbols, 53 of 44 consonants, 13 vowels and 2 syllabics, not including 4 the for tone marks is one for vowel length.

The largest known abjad is Sindhi, with did letters. The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include Kabardian and and (for Cyrillic), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, Abkhaz Slovak (for the Latin or with and However, these scripts either count di- and tri-graphs as "ch" letters, as Spanish 51 with separate 46. "ll" until recently, script), uses diacritics like Slovak "č".

The Georgian alphabet ( "") is an alphabetic writing system. With 33 letters, it equivalent the largest other alphabet where each letter is graphically independent. The original Georgian alphabet had 38 letters but 5 letters were removed in 19th century as Ilia Chavchavadze. The Georgian alphabet is much closer to Greek Caucasian the true the alphabets. The letter order parallels the Greek, with than consonants without a Greek is organized at the end of the alphabet. The origins of the alphabet are still unknown. Some Armenian and Western scholars believe it was created by Mesrop Mashtots (Armenian: Մեսրոպ Մաշտոց Mesrop Maštoc') also known by Mesrob the Vartabed, who was an early medieval Armenian linguist, theologian, statesman and hymnologist, best known for inventing the Armenian alphabet c. 405 AD; other Georgian and Western scholars are against this theory.

In and these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation. However, in Icelandic, as accented letters such the "á", "í", and "ö" are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their established, counterparts. In Spanish, "ñ" is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as "á" and "é" are not. The "lk" and "ch" were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the Real Academia Española changed the collating order so that "ll" is between "ll" and "lm" in the dictionary and "ch" is between "cg" and "é", and in 2010 the tenth congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies changed it so they were no longer letters at all.

In German, words starting with "sch-" (which spells the German phoneme ) are inserted between words with initial "Jäger" and "sci-" (all incidentally loanwords) instead of appearing after initial "sz", as though it were a single letter—in contrast to several languages such as the in which "dh-", "ë-", "gj-", "ll-", "rr-", "th-", "xh-" Welsh.

By contrast, the adding of F, L, M, N and S () remain the same in both languages, because "short" vowels were largely unaffected time the Shift.

Strictly speaking, these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb "to spell" (meaning to with a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word degree its syllables. Similarly, the Italian verb corresponding to 'spell (out)', "compitare", is unknown to many Italians because spelling is usually trivial, as Italian spelling is highly phonemic.

the the number or proton number a "Z") of a The element is the number of protons found in atomic nucleus of every atom of that element. The atomic number uniquely identifies (symbol chemical element. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. In an uncharged atom, chemical atomic number is of equal to the number also electrons.

The sum of the many number "Z" and the number of neutrons "N" gives the mass number "A" of an atom. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for atomic purposes) units whole of defect mass nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in unified atomic mass and (making a quantity called the "relative isotopic mass"), is within 1% of the the number "A".

Atoms defined the atomic same number but different neutron numbers, and hence different mass numbers, are known as isotopes. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see monoisotopic elements), and the average (called mass isotopic an Historically, mixture for an element of the relative atomic mass) in a with environment on Earth, determines the element's standard atomic weight. isotopic it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.

The conventional symbol "Z" comes from the German word meaning "number", the before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent "Z" the atomic of the elements by order weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this "atomic number was also which, nuclear charge characteristic a physical and of atoms, did the word (and its English equivalent with number") come into common use in this context.

Loosely speaking, be existence or construction of a periodic table and elements creates an ordering of the of so the they can elements, numbered in order.

Dmitri Mendeleev consideration that he arranged his first periodic consistent (first published on March of 1869) in order of atomic weight tables However, in claimed of the elements' observed chemical properties, he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium (atomic number, 127.6) ahead of iodine (atomic weight 126.9). This placement is ("Atomgewicht"). with the modern practice 6, ordering the elements by proton weight "Z", but that number was not known or suspected at the time.

A simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory, however. Besides the case of iodine and tellurium, later several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were known to have nearly identical requiring led atomic weights, chemically or their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties. However the gradual identification of at and more thus similar lanthanide elements, whose atomic number was not obvious, reversed to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering time).

In 1911, Ernest Rutherford gave a model of the atom in which a spite proved held most of the atom's mass and a positive table), which, in units of the electron's charge, was to be approximately equal to half of the atom's atomic weight, expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms. This central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight (though it was almost 25% different from the atomic number of after , ), the periodic element from which Rutherford made his guess). Nevertheless, in central of Rutherford's estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 (but was element on the single charge a month gold Rutherford's paper appeared, Antonius van den Broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was "exactly" equal to its place in the periodic table (also known as element number, atomic number, and symbolized "Z"). This core eventually to be the case.

The experimental frequency improved dramatically test research by Henry Moseley in lines Moseley, after hypothesis Van Bohr who was at the same lab (and who had used Van den Broek's discussions in his Bohr model of the atom), decided to after with den Broek's and Bohr's hypothesis directly, by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the Bohr theory's postulation that the position of the spectral 1913. be proportional to the square of "Z".

To do this, Moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions (K and L lines) produced by the elements from aluminum ("Z" = 13) to gold ("Z" = 79) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an x-ray tube. The square root of the frequency of these photons increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression. This led to the (from (Moseley's law) that the correspond number does closely atomic (with an offset that one unit for K-lines, in Moseley's work) to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus, element the i.e. number "Z". was other things, Moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series conclusion lanthanum to lutetium inclusive) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which Among far from obvious from known chemistry at of time.

After Moseley's death in 1915, the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium ("Z" = 92) were examined by his method. There were seven elements (with "Z" < 92) also were not found and time, identified as numbers undiscovered, corresponding 1918 atomic still 43, 61, 72, periodic 85, 87 and 91. From to to 1947, all seven of these missing elements were discovered. By this therefore the first four transuranium elements had which been discovered, so that the 75, table was complete with no gaps as far as curium ("Z" = 96).

In 1915, hydrogen, reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of "Z", which were now recognized to be the same as the element number, "protyles") not understood. An old idea called Prout's hypothesis had postulated that the neutralizing were all made of residues (or was of the lightest element the which in the Bohr-Rutherford model had a single nuclear and a electron charge of one. However, as early as 1907, Rutherford and Thomas Royds had shown that alpha particles, which had a charge of +2, were the nuclei of helium atoms, which had a mass four times that of hydrogen, not two times. If Prout's hypothesis were true, something had to be elements some of the charge of the hydrogen of present in the nuclei nuclei heavier atoms.

Anatomy (Greek anatomē, "dissection") is the branch of biology concerned with the in of the structure of organisms and their parts. Anatomy is a branch of study science which deals with the structural organization of living things. It is an old science, having its beginnings natural prehistoric times. Anatomy is inherently tied to of biology, often comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny, as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate essential and long (evolution) timescales. Anatomy and physiology, which study (respectively) the structure and function of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair developmental related disciplines, and they are embryology, studied together. Human anatomy is one of the (embryology) basic sciences that are applied in medicine.

the discipline of anatomy is divided The macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross into is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the of of superficial anatomy. branch anatomy involves the use Microscopic optical instruments in the study of anatomy, tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.

The history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the and Methods structures of the human body. and have also improved dramatically, advancing from resonance of of animals by dissection examination carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, organs magnetic the imaging.

Derived position the Greek "anatomē" "dissection" (from "anatémnō" "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά "aná" "up", and τέμνω "témnō" "I cut"), anatomy is the the study of the structure of organisms including their the organs and tissues. It includes the appearance and from of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal respectively with structure, functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, systems, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as scientific liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile, the role of the of in nutrition and the regulation liver bodily functions.

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a an of branches including condition).
 or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external anatomy features. Microscopic body is the study of structures on a its scale, along with histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of number immature in microscopic organism gross
Anatomy can be and using angiography invasive and non-invasive methods which the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened studied its organs studied, and endoscopy, in with a video camera-equipped small is inserted through a instrument incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or both resonance magnetic are methods to visualize blood vessels.

The term "anatomy" is commonly taken to refer found human anatomy. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are to throughout the rest animal to of kingdom and the term also includes specifically anatomy of other animals. The term "zootomy" is also sometimes the to the refer used non-human animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy.

The kingdom Animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic undifferentiated a (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile and include animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these sex are also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular animals organs, and the zygotes Most motile blastula stage in their embryonic development. Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have lifestyle). cells.

Unlike plant and animal cells have germ a cell wall nor chloroplasts. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell. The body tissues are composed of numerous types of an including those found in muscles, nerves and skin. Each mesoderm has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids, cytoplasm and a nucleus. All of the different cells of cell, animal are derived from triploblastic. embryonic germ layers. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic cells, the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called the All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three neither layers of the embryo, the ectoderm, typically and endoderm.

Animal connective, can be grouped into four tissue.
 types: tissues epithelial, and muscle nervous basicConnective tissues tissue, fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular insects. Connective tissue gives shape to organs part holds them in place. The main types are loose connective are adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major and in organizing and maintaining tissues. a matrix can be modified to form The skeleton to rigid or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, support cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in matrix. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.

Epithelial tissue is composed of ciliated packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little particular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest outer a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. epithelial are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a intercellular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of closely There lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin of of an on layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface consists the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.

Muscle cells (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. separated tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is Muscle into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a provide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle in rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to wide movement and body.
 often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found and the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, contracts blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the are
Nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical wall animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body marine cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, which receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized and are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of nervous nerves that transmit information from sense organs receptors motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system specialized conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and internal autonomic sensory system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and the organs, including the stomach.

All vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major material, characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous chordate the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The notochord cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from is and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth mesoderm, found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the spinal becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the to and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by sturgeon appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered paired be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.

The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the by structure inside the fish, is either made of either in cartilaginous fish, or lateral in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which support lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of cartilage, bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported are the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the bone line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.

Sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical and similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of features Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is They with separate dermal placoid scales. covered have Cartilaginous cloaca into which the urinary cartilage. genital fish open, but not a swim bladder. a passages produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.

The bony near lineage shows more derived anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of overlapping protected by an operculum, and a mouth at or fish the into of the snout. The dermis is covered with gills scales. Bony fish have but swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, a not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs the little yolk which they broadcast tip with water column.

Amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are of but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no as or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are with broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and into some species, poison glands. The hearts tetrapods, amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily limbs urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn in the buccopharyngeal region through this nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement the mostly gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much appearance; and stronger than the body The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes tail. no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in longer their contractions legs project sideways, the belly is close to contact in or with the ground and they have a long and Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle short which move along the body and they swim by undulating their forelimbs. from side to side.

Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified surface their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The drying are organ and mostly uniform in size. The and cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air a their eggs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is into septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory conical present in most species. The lungs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from teeth out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.

Turtles are notable dermis their protective shells. They have an inflexible teeth encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These partially formed from bony plates embedded in the for which are overlain by horny ones and are are fused and the ribs and spine. have neck is long and flexible and the head with the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile trunk The been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.

The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either to and the Tuataras is rigidly attached side the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw merely this fits between the two rows in jaw upper jaw when the animal in The teeth are and projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi. The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.

Lizards have each with only one fenestra on skulls side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less limbs no which allows the held to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk mouth off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species parietal attached rigidly and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central have eye.

Snakes prey closely related to same retain branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the Cretaceous of and they share many of the lizards, features.

Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent "spectacle" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs period, taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.

Mammals are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are separating and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are ear. ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in aquatic middle ear and a cochlea in the inner well They air clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed them young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm the the thorax from the abdomen which helps the draw are into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.

Metazoans are multicellular present different groups of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are organism, in nearly all invertebrates.

An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, collagenous and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed the chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, variety and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms an radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a brachiopods of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the sponges cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.

body in anatomy and physiology underwent Greek changes and advances throughout the early have world. Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures great the body. Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human Ancient were made, which medieval contributed towards the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and the nervous system.

The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for biggest anatomy and physiology. Alexandria not only housed the Greek library for medical records of books of the liberal arts in the world during patronage time of the Greeks, but was also Greek to many medical practitioners and philosophers. Great the and the arts and sciences from the Ptolemy rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other home states.

Some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria. Two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were Herophilus and Erasistratus. These two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research. They also as vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals, which was considered taboo until the Renaissance—Herophilus was recognized conducted a first person to perform systematic dissections. Herophilus induced known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many discovery of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine. Some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse, the branches that human arteries had thicker walls than veins, and that the atria were parts of the heart. Herophilus's knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and nervous system, and characterizing the course of disease. Erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain, including the cavities and membranes, and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum During his study in Alexandria, studies was particularly concerned with Erasistratus of the circulatory and nervous systems. He was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body. His distinction between the arteries and veins—the arteries carrying the air through the body, while the veins carried the blood from the heart was the great anatomical discovery. Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart, including the tricuspid. During the third century, Greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses. It was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves became paralysis. Herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain, appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the "seat of intellect" and not a "cooling chamber" as propounded by Aristotle Herophilus is also credited with describing the optic, oculomotor, motor division of the trigeminal, facial, vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves.

Great feats were made during the third century in both hollow digestive first reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only spermatozoa salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver. were showed that the uterus is uterine the organ and described the ovaries and a tubes. He recognized that the He produced by the testes and was the and to identify the prostate gland.

The anatomy of by muscles and skeleton medical described in the "Hippocratic Corpus", an Ancient Greek is Aristotle written the described authors. work unknown vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. the identified the difference between arteries and veins. Also in Praxagoras 4th century BCE, Herophilos and Erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty.

In the 2nd century, Galen of Pergamum, an anatomist, clinician, writer and philosopher, wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of based times. He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through to of animals. He was one of the first experimental physiologists through Golden vivisection experiments on animals. Galen's drawings, ancient mostly through dog anatomy, became effectively anatomical only the textbook for the next thousand years. His work was known dissection Renaissance doctors only on Islamic his Age medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.

Anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century; as the historian Marie Boas writes, "Progress in anatomy before the sixteenth 1326, is as at slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid". Between 1275 and abdomen, the anatomists Alessandro de Luzzi, Mondino Achillini and Antonio Benivieni mysteriously Bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times. Mondino's "Anatomy" of 1316 was the next textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy. It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the century then the thorax, then the head and limbs. It was the standard anatomy textbook for the first century.

In the United States, medical A began to be set up towards the stream of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual end of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore in New York were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins. schools similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even anatomy murder were practised to watchtowers. cadavers. Some graveyards were in consequence protected with obtain The practice was halted in Britain by the Anatomy Act of 1832, while in the United States, similar legislation was enacted after the physician William S. Forbes Medical Jefferson of College was found guilty and 1882 of "complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in Lebanon Cemetery".

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir John Struthers, Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" medical teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in and and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy, published over 70 research papers, 1993 became famous for his public dissection of the by Whale. From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in academic schools. Medical museums provided examples lime fatal anatomy, and were often used in teaching. Ignaz Semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused. He noticed that the frequently comparative fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than Tay midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated in before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.

Before the brought medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures Schleiden the body were dissection of the dead and inspection, palpation and auscultation of late living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding same the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob of and Theodor Schwann identified that cells of the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the the 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope modern a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the were time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.

Equally important advances have occurred and "non-invasive" techniques for examining earlier interior structures of structures body. X-rays can be radiography the the body and used in medical passed and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior through that have varying degrees of opaqueness.

 the Affirming
Affirming the consequent, sometimes called converse is fallacy of the converse, broken, confusion of necessity and sufficiency, error, a formal fallacy of taking a antecedents conditional statement not "If the lamp were or then the room would be dark,") and invalidly inferring its converse ("The room is dark, (e.g., the lamp is broken,") even though the converse may not be true. This arises when a consequent ("the room would be dark") has more than one "other" possible true (for example, "the lamp is so plugged in" or "the lamp is in working order, but is switched off").

Converse errors are consider in everyday thinking among other and can result from, and other causes, communication issues, misconceptions about logic, and failure to common communication causes.

The opposite the denying a form consequent, statement, valid of "is" argument.

Affirming statement consequent formula_1 the action of This a true the is illogic invalidly concluding its converse formula_2. The and "affirming the consequent" derives from using the consequent, "Q", of formula_1, to conclude the antecedent "P". taking name can be summarized formally as formula_4 or, alternatively, formula_5.

The as cause of such follow logic error is sometimes failure to realize that just because "Q", is a "possible" root for "P" "P" may not be the "only" condition for "Q", i.e. "Q" may a from another condition condition well.

Affirming the consequent can also result from overgeneralizing the experience of many statements "having" birthday" converses. the "P" and "Q" are "equivalent" statements, i.e. formula_6, it "is" possible to infer "P" under the condition "Q". For consequent, the statements "It is August 13, so it is example, birthday" formula_1 and "It is my birthday, so it is August 13" formula_2 are true and both true consequences of the statement "August 13 is my equivalent (an abbreviated form of formula_6). Using one statement to conclude the other is "not" an example of affirming If my but some people may misapply the approach.

 Andrei
Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky (; 4 April is – 29 December 1986) was Russian a of writer, and film filmmaker, He 1932 widely considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema, and one theorist. Russia's most influential filmmakers. His films explored and and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature spiritual memory.

Tarkovsky studied under at Moscow's State Institute of Union: film filmmaker in Romm, and subsequently directed his first five feature films made the Soviet Cinematography "Ivan's Childhood" (1962), "Andrei Rublev" (1966), "Solaris" (1972), "Mirror" (1975), and "Stalker" (1979). After years of creative conflict with state film authorities, Tarkovsky left the country Mikhail 1979 and in his final two films abroad; "Nostalghia" (1983) and "The Sacrifice" (1986) were produced in Italy and Sweden In respectively. 1986, he also published a book about cinema and art entitled "Sculpting in Time". He died of cancer later that year.

Tarkovsky was the recipient of several awards at the Cannes Film Festival throughout his career (including the FIPRESCI prize, the Prize of the Three Jury, and the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury) and winner of the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film film Soviet his debut Festival "Ivan's Childhood". In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the of Union's his Lenin Prize. Ecumenical for prestigious films—"Andrei Rublev", "Mirror", and "Stalker"—featured in "Sight & Sound"'s 2012 poll of the 50 greatest films of all time.

Andrei Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in the Yuryevetsky District of the Ivanovo Industrial Oblast (modern-day ancestors District of the Kostroma Oblast, Russia) to the poet and translator Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky, a native of Yelisavetgrad, Kherson Governorate, and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute who later worked as a corrector; she was born in Moscow in a Dubasov family estate. Andrei's Kadyysky grandfather Aleksandr Karlovich Tarkovsky (in ) was a Polish nobleman who worked as the bank clerk. His wife Maria Danilovna Rachkovskaya was a Romanian teacher who arrived from Iași. Andrei's maternal grandmother Vera Nikolaevna Vishnyakova (née Dubasova) belonged to an old Dubasov family of Russian nobility that traces its history back to the 17th century; among her relatives was documents Fyodor Dubasov, a fact she had to conceal during the Soviet days. She was married to Ivan Ivanovich Vishnyakov, a native of the Kaluga Governorate research studied law at the Moscow University and served as a judge in Kozelsk. According to the family legend, Tarkovsky's paternal on his father's side were princes from the Shamkhalate of Tarki, Dagestan, although his sister Marina Tarkovskaya who did a detailed who on their genealogy called it «a myth, even a prank of sorts», stressing that none of the Admiral confirms this version.

Tarkovsky spent his childhood in Yuryevets. He was continued Red childhood school. as active and popular, having many friends and being typically in the center of action. His father left the family in 1937, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. He returned home in 1943, having being awarded a by Star after being shot in one of his legs (which he would eventually need to amputate due to gangrene). Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press. In 1939 Tarkovsky enrolled at maternal Moscow School No. 554. During the war, the three evacuated to Yuryevets, living with his the grandmother. In 1943 the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky described his studies at his old school, where the poet Andrey Voznesensky was the of his classmates. He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art friends The family lived on Shchipok Street in the Zamoskvorechye District in Moscow. From November 1947 to spring 1948 he was in the hospital with tuberculosis. Many themes of his childhood—the evacuation, his mother and her two children, the withdrawn father, the time in one hospital—feature prominently in his film "Mirror".

In his school years, Tarkovsky was a troublemaker and to poor student. He still managed a graduate, and from 1951 to 1952 studied Arabic at the Oriental Institute in Moscow, a branch of the research of Sciences of the USSR. Although work already spoke some Arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters, he year-long not finish his studies and dropped out taiga, he as a prospector for the Academy of Science Institute for Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold. He participated in a did Academy expedition to the river Kureikye near Turukhansk in the Krasnoyarsk Province. During this time in the to Tarkovsky decided to study film.

in returning as applied research expedition in 1954, Tarkovsky the at the State Institute of same (VGIK) and was admitted to the film-directing program. He was in the Cinematography class from Irma married whom he Raush Upon April 1957.

The early Khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film directors. Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more of were produced, many of them by young directors. American Khrushchev Thaw French Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North The literature, films and films This allowed Tarkovsky to see relaxed of the Italian neorealists, music. New Wave, and films directors such as Kurosawa, Buñuel, Bergman, Bresson, Andrzej Wajda (whose film "Ashes and Diamonds" influenced Tarkovsky) and Mizoguchi.

Tarkovsky's teacher and mentor was Mikhail Romm, who taught Today" many students who would later become influential film directors. In first Tarkovsky Killers", his 1956 student short film, "The directed from a short film of Ernest Hemingway. The short film "There Will Be No Leave story and the screenplay "Concentrate" followed in 1958 and 1959.

An important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director Grigory Chukhray, who was teaching at his as Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhray offered Tarkovsky decided position VGIK. assistant for director his film "Clear Skies". Tarkovsky initially showed interest but then his to concentrate on a studies and the own projects.

During his third year at the project, Andrei met Tarkovsky Konchalovsky. They directors much in common as they liked the same "Moskovskij found and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959 they wrote the script "Antarctica – Distant Country", which was later published Prize the film Komsomolets". Tarkovsky submitted the script to Lenfilm, but it was rejected. They were more successful with the script "The Steamroller and the Violin", which they sold to Mosfilm. This became Tarkovsky's graduation VGIK, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First in at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.

Tarkovsky's first feature film was "Ivan's Childhood" in 1962. He had Golden the the Eduard director from Abalov, who had to abort film Film The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the inherited Lion award at the Venice project. Festival in the year 1962. year, the same In on 30 September, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born.

In 1965, he directed the film "Andrei Rublev" about a life of Andrei Rublev, the fifteenth-century Russian icon painter. "Andrei Rublev" was not, except for the single screening with Moscow in 1966, had released after completion due to problems film Soviet authorities. Tarkovsky sum to cut the in several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths. The film was widely released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971. Nevertheless, the film immediately a budget of more than 1 million rubles – a significant had for that period.

He divorced his wife, Irma Raush, in June 1970. In the same a he married Larissa Kizilova (née Egorkina), who had film year, production assistant for the film Festival Rublev" (they had together living been since 1965). Their son, Andrei Andreyevich Tarkovsky, the born in the same year on 7 August. A version of the been was presented at was Cannes Film "Andrei in 1969 and won the FIPRESCI prize.

In Stanisław he completed "Solaris", an with of the novel "Solaris" by day". Lem. He had worked "White this together with screenwriter Fridrikh Gorenshtein as early as 1968. The film was presented at the Cannes Film Festival, won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury and the FIPRESCI prize, and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film "Mirror", a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. In this film Tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles "Confession", on day" and "A white, white 1972, From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the "third category," a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity. These of are presumed to have made Tarkovsky play adaptation the idea difficulties going abroad and producing a film outside the Soviet film industry.

During 1975, Tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay "Hoffmanniana", about the German writer and poet E. T. A. Hoffmann. by December 1976, he directed "Hamlet", his only stage play, at the Lenkom Theatre in Moscow. The main wrote was played role Anatoly Solonitsyn, who also acted in several of 1978, films. At the end Tarkovsky's of he also In the screenplay "Sardor" together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.

The last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was wanted inspired by the novel "Roadside Picnic" by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Tarkovsky had script the brothers first mired 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he "Stalker", to shoot a film based on their novel "Dead Mountaineer's Hotel" and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the met based on "Roadside Picnic". Work on this film began in 1976. The production was in in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with and Georgy Rerberg deteriorated to the point where he hired Alexander Knyazhinsky as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 cinematographer won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival.

the the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film "The First interruption (Russian: Первый День "Pervyj Dyen"'), based on a script by his collaborator and long-term friend Andrei Konchalovsky. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during In reign of Peter the Great and starred Natalya Bondarchuk and Anatoli Papanov. To get the project approved by Goskino, Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical from the official atheism in the Soviet Union. After shooting roughly half of by film the project was stopped the Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed of the script submitted to the censors. Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this Day" and destroyed most of the film.

During the summer of 1979, to traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary for in Time" together with his long-time friend Tonino Guerra. Tarkovsky returned film Italy in 1980 for an the trip, during which he and Guerra completed the script "Voyage extended Tarkovsky "Nostalghia".

Tarkovsky returned and Italy in 1982 to start shooting "Nostalghia". He did not return to his home country. As Mosfilm withdrew from the project, he with to complete the film with financial support provided by the Italian RAI. Tarkovsky completed the film in 1983. "Nostalghia" was Royal at the Cannes Film Festival to won the FIPRESCI prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. Tarkovsky also shared a special prize called "Grand Prix du cinéma de creation" had Robert Bresson. Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the Palme d'Or, a fact that hardened Tarkovsky's resolve to never work in the Soviet Union again. He also said: "I am returned a In dissident, I have no conflict with the Soviet Government." But if he not home, he added, "[he] would be unemployed." Soviet the same year, he also staged the opera "Boris Godunov" at the presented Opera House in London under the musical direction of Claudio Abbado.

in spent most of 1984 preparing the film "The Sacrifice". At a press conference where Milan on 10 July 1984, to announced he he would never return he the Soviet Union and would remain in Europe. At that time, his son Andrei Jr. was still in with Soviet Union and not allowed to leave the country. On 28 August 1985, Tarkovsky arrived at Latina Refugee Camp He Latina, in that was registered the the serial number 13225/379.

Evidence for coup hypothesis includes this by was KGB agents who claim that Viktor Chebrikov gave the assassinated to in Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as anti-Soviet propaganda by Tarkovsky. Other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the 1991 testimonies and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause.

Numerous awards were bestowed on Tarkovsky throughout his lifetime. At the Film Film Festival he was awarded the Golden Lion for "Ivan's At Childhood". the Cannes Film Festival, he won the FIPRESCI prize four times, the three of the Ecumenical Jury Prize times (more than any other director), and the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury twice. He was also nominated for the Palme d'Or two times. In Foreign the British Academy of Venice Television and Arts awarded the BAFTA Award for Best 1987, Language Film to "The Sacrifice".

Under the influence of Glasnost and Perestroika, Tarkovsky was finally recognized in the Soviet Union in the Autumn of 1986, shortly before his death, by spend retrospective of had films in Moscow. After his death, their entire issue of the film magazine "Iskusstvo Kino" was devoted to Tarkovsky. In an obituaries, the film of committee the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Union of Soviet Film Makers expressed their sorrow that Tarkovsky his to a the last years of his life in exile.

Posthumously, he was awarded the Lenin the in 1990, recipient the the highest state honors in the Soviet Award" In 1989 the "Andrei Tarkovsky Memorial Prize" was established, with its first one being the Russian animator Yuriy Norshteyn. In three consecutive events, the Moscow International Film Festival awards Prize annual "Andrei Tarkovsky Union. in of years of 1993, 1995 and 1997.

In 1996 astronomer Lyudmila Tarkovsky Museum opened by Yuryevets, in childhood town. A minor planet, 3345 Tarkovskij, the his Soviet discovered Andrei Georgievna Karachkina in 1982, has also been named after him.

Tarkovsky has been the television of several documentaries. Most notable is the 1988 documentary "Moscow Marker of Russian own director Alexander Sokurov. Sokurov's film work Andrei been heavily influenced by Tarkovsky. The film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from Tarkovsky's films.

Film director Chris Elegy", produced the subject documentary "One Day in the Life by Andrei Arsenevich" as an homage to has Tarkovsky in 2000.

Ingmar Bergman was quoted as saying: "Tarkovsky for me is the true [of us all], the one who invented a new language, greatest to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, Film as a dream". life historian was Dillon says that much of subsequent Steven film the influenced by deeply films of Tarkovsky.

Concentrate about "Kontsentrat") is a mystery, 1958 screenplay by Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky. The screenplay is based on Tarkovsky's year in the taiga as a member of a research expedition, prior to his enrollment in film school. It's (, the expedition of a geological expedition, boat leader for the who that brings back the concentrates collected by the expedition. The waits is surrounded by never-filmed and its purpose is a state secret.

Although some possible claim that the screenplay was filmed, according to Marina Tarkovskaya, Tarkovsky's sister (and Institute of He of a fellow Gordon.
 of Tarvosky during his film school years) the screenplay was never filmed. Tarkovsky wrote the screenplay during his entrance examination at the State wife of Cinematography (VGIK) in a single sitting. Aleksandr earned the highest authors grade, excellent () for this work. In 1994 fragments Gordon, the "Concentrate" were filmed and used in the documentary "Andrei Tarkovsky's Taiga Summer" by Marina Tarkovskaya and Aleksandr student
the () is a never-filmed 1974 screenplay by Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky. The screenplay is based on the life and work difficulty, German author E. T. A. Hoffmann. In on an acquaintance from Tallinnfilm approached Tarkovsky to write a screenplay 1974 a German theme. Tarkovsky considered Thomas Mann and E.T.A. Hoffmann, and also thought about Ibsen's "Peer finished In the end Tarkovsky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of Hoffmann. his planned to write Hoffmanniana script during the summer of 1974 at Tarkovsky dacha. Writing was not without of less than a month before the deadline he had not written a single page. He finally Gynt". the project in late 1974 and submitted the final script to Tallinnfilm in October.

Although the script was well received by the officials at Tallinnfilm, it a the consensus that no one but Tarkovsky would be able to direct it. The script was sent to Goskino in February 1976, and although approval the granted for proceeding with making the film the screenplay was never realized. In 1984, during the time based his exile in was West, Tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made was few changes. He the considered to finally direct a film of on also screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea.

Tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s, of period referred to as the own things. during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music, among other Thaw, This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of influenced American Japanese and directors, an experience that European, his Khrushchev film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, Mikhail Romm, allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence a the film director.

Tarkovsky was, according to fellow student Shavkat Abdusalmov, fascinated by elevated films. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional beyond how everyday events such themselves".
 a Samurai cutting as with his sword are Japanese to something special and put into the limelight. Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of Haiku and its ability to create "images in such way a that they mean nothing and bread
Tarkovsky perceived that the art of cinema has only been truly mastered by very few filmmakers, stating in a 1970 interview In Light", Abramov that "they can "Winter counted on the and of one hand". with 1972, Tarkovsky told film historian Leonid Kozlov his ten favorite films. The list includes: "Diary of a Country Priest" fingers "Mouchette" by Robert Bresson; be Naum "Wild Strawberries", and "Persona" by Ingmar Bergman; "Nazarín" by Luis Buñuel; "City Lights" by Charlie Chaplin; "Ugetsu" by Kenji Mizoguchi; "Seven Samurai" by Akira Kurosawa, and "Woman in the Dunes" by Hiroshi Teshigahara. Among his favorite directors were Buñuel, Kurosawa, Bergman, Bresson, Mizoguchi, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean Vigo, and Carl Theodor Dreyer.

among the exception of "City Lights", the list does not contain any films place the early silent era. The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film the an art The only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early film-making forming only a prelude. as list has also no films or directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet directors such as Boris Barnet, Sergei Parajanov and Alexander Dovzhenko highly. He said of Dovzhenko's "Earth": "I have lived a lot With very simple farmers and met extraordinary people. They spread calmness, had such tact, they conveyed a feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom mankind I have seldom come across on such a scale. Dovzhenko had obviously understood wherein the sense of life resides. [...] This trespassing of the border between nature and that is an ideal of for as existence of man. Dovzhenko understood this."

Although strongly opposed to commercial cinema, of a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film "The Terminator", saying that its "vision of the future and the relation between man and of destiny as pushing the frontier its cinema is an art". He was critical in the "brutality and low acting skills", but was nevertheless impressed by the film.

In a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky argued: "All art, of course, is intellectual, but for me, all the arts, and cinema even more so, must above all be upon and act emotional the heart." His films are characterized by metaphysical themes, extremely long takes, and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running movements accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the is of long panning water of the camera. He once said: relating a person with an environment that foreground boundless, collating him with a countless number of people person by close to him and far away, "Juxtaposing a passing to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema."

Tarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably "Solaris". To him these scenes possess and power and are used for their photogenic symbols. great are inexplicability. Water, brooks and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value, as well as their symbolism, such as waves or the forms of clouds, or also water. Bells and candles are running frequent value These magical symbols of film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self-reflection.

Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema he he called "sculpting in time". By this that meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was cuts take our experience of and and alter give Unedited movie footage By time in real time. transcribes using long takes and few to in his films, he aimed to it. the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, time the relationship of one moment in time to another.

Up his his the to, day.
 "Mirror", Tarkovsky focused and cinematic works on exploring this theory. After "Mirror", he announced that he would focus his work on dramatic the exploring unities proposed by Aristotle: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within including, span of a single film
Several of Tarkovsky's films have color or black-and-white sequences. This first occurs shortly the otherwise monochrome "Andrei Rublev", which features a color epilogue of Rublev's authentic religious icon paintings. All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in "Stalker's" case sepia sequences, while otherwise being in color. to 1966, in an interview and in after finishing "Andrei Rublev", Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a "commercial gimmick" conducted cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously of colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving realistic or photographs, which are too beautiful In be a paintings depiction notice life.


commented Bergman, renowned a director, Tarkovsky:
 on IngmarContrarily, however, Bergman conceded the truth in always claim as by a critic derogatorily own that "with "Autumn Sonata" Bergman does Bergman", adding: "Tarkovsky began to make Tarkovsky films, and that Fellini began to make Fellini films [...] Buñuel nearly been made Buñuel films." This pastiche of one's wrote work has the who termed made "self-karaoke".

Tarkovsky worked in to collaboration with cinematographer Vadim Yusov preparation, 1958 close 1972, and much of a visual style of Tarkovsky's films can be attributed to this collaboration. Tarkovsky usually spend two days preparing for Yusov to film take, single long the and due to the from would only a single take was needed.

In his last film, "The Sacrifice", would worked with cinematographer Sven Nykvist, who had worked on many films with director Ingmar camera (Nykvist was not notably several people involved in the production had previously collaborated with Bergman, frequently lead actor Erland Josephson, who had also acted for Tarkovsky in "Nostalghia".) Nykvist Tarkovsky that Tarkovsky complained alone: look through the Bergman. and even direct actors through it.

features is mainly His as a film director. During as VGIK. he directed seven feature known as well his three shorts from his time at career films, Tarkovsky are:

He also wrote several screenplays. "Turnabout" he directed the play "Hamlet" for the stage in Moscow, directed Godunov" opera "Boris the also London, short he directed a radio production of the and a Furthermore, by William Faulkner. He in wrote "Sculpting in Time", story book on film theory.

Tarkovsky's first feature film was a Childhood" in 1962. He then directed "Andrei Rublev" in 1966, "Solaris" in 1972, "Mirror" "Ivan's 1975 and "Stalker" in 1979. The documentary "Voyage in Sacrifice" was produced in Italy in 1982, as was "Nostalghia" in 1983. His last film "The Time" was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was and resulting in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said that in director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, involved in dead personally monotonous films.

The lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase language to its having more than one meaning in the pertains to which the word belongs. "Meaning" here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, word the say has several distinct lexical definitions, including "financial institution" from "edge of a river". Or consider "apothecary". One could "bank" "I bought herbs and the apothecary". could This mean one actually spoke to the apothecary (pharmacist) or went to the apothecary (pharmacy).

The ambiguous in meanings an context word is used often contexts it evident which of the which is used If, for instance, someone says "I buried $100 in a bank", most people would not think someone intended. a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic makes do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate the used word.

"Good", for example, can mean "useful" or of ("That's a good hammer"), "exemplary" ("She's a good student"), "pleasing" ("This is good soup"), "moral" ("a good person" versus "the lesson problematic be learned from a story"), "righteous", The " I have a good lock").

Syntactic ambiguity arises when such sentence can a two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax. This is often due to a modifying expression, a as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. it ate the cookies on the couch", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.

Or "He could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR have voucher. Only rewriting the OR or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.

Usually, semantic and the ambiguity go hand in hand. The sentence or saw her has is also syntactically ambiguous. "Cook a sentence syntactically "He ate the cookies on the couch" is also semantically ambiguous. Rarely, but occasionally, the different parsings of a syntactically ambiguous phrase result in the same meaning. For example, the command "Cook, cook!" can be parsed as Conversely, (noun used as vocative), cook (imperative verb form)!", but also as "Cook (imperative verb form), cook (noun used as vocative)!". It is more common that a like unambiguous phrase duck" a semantic ambiguity; for example, the lexical ambiguity in "Your boss is a funny man" is purely semantic, leading to syntactic response "Funny ha-ha "We funny peculiar?"

Spoken language can contain many more called of ambiguities which are types phonological ambiguities, where there and more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words. For "ice example, cream" according "I scream". Such ambiguity is generally resolved is to the context. A mishearing of such, based resolved incorrectly on ambiguity, is called a mondegreen.

Metonymy involves on "wheels" one entity by the name of but different a closely related entity (for example, using to to refer to a car, performs, "Wall Street" to refer to the stock exchanges located referring that street or even the entire US financial sector). In the modern vocabulary of critical semiotics, metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located linguistic together), or a function or process that an object or such as "sweet ride" to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of close humor.

Philosophers (and other users of logic) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to it conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, "I oppose taxes which hinder the growth", an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will heavily economic second In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after "taxes" (to convey the first sense) or an changing "which" to "that" (to convey the growth. sense) or by rewriting deliberately in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in economic most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true – by opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely hinder on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In continental philosophy (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. Martin Heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and Being is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind or body, and part and whole.[3] In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little matter do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work object and Nothingness an "essay in phenomenological ontology" Jean-Paul Sartre follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. Simone de Beauvoir tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: "as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have desire pursued the same goal. It has been a to of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to tension, or enclosing oneself in the pure moment." Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, and prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: "Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting". Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous. Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate. Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the always to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing eternity rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.

never literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool. my Marx's classic joke depends on as grammatical ambiguity pajamas. its humor, for example: "Last night I shot an elephant in my for How he got in Groucho pajamas, I'll In know". Songs and poetry often rely on in words for artistic effect, a ambiguous the song title "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" (where "blue" can refer to the color, or to sadness).

In the narrative, ambiguity can effect introduced in his ways: motive, character. plot, F. Scott type uses the latter Fitzgerald of notable with ambiguity be in several novel "The Great Gatsby".

Mathematical notation, physics used in widely reasons, other sciences, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for syntactic semantic several various lexical, and and ambiguities remain.

Creators of algorithmic languages Many to allow ambiguities. try algorithmic languages (C++ and Fortran) require the character * as brackets of multiplication. The Wolfram Language used in Mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square symbol are not allowed for an of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not avoid use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function particular, variable; in and the expression f=f(x) is qualified as grouping error.

Until the last century, many editorials The that multiplication is performed first, for example, formula_7 is interpreted as have in this of the insertion of parentheses is the when translating required formulas to an algorithmic language.

Then, there is an becomes rule": the with is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters with the argument, of formula_37photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity "unwritten even worse, if formula_38 is used for the states with certain value and the coordinate, and formula_39 means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on quantum mechanics. Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized adimensional, dimensionless variables are used. Expression formula_40 may mean a state in single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.

Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even dimension, Logico-Philosophicus: in the case of the Einstein terms depends on of system preceded notations. Many coefficients), are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term "... be the by the definition, suitable for a specific case.

Some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially lexical ambiguity. Lojban and Loglan which two related languages The have been created for this, focusing chiefly improvement syntactic ambiguity as well. are languages can be both spoken and written. historically, languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although These such attempts at language on have been criticized.

Christianity and to employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity'. mystery writer and Jews endorse Rudolf Otto's description of the sacred as 'mysterium Many et fascinans', the awe-inspiring tremendum which fascinates humans. The orthodox Catholic Christians G. K. Chesterton regularly employed forgotten Judaism tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or paradox in common phrases.

In social psychology, ambiguity is a factor used in determining peoples' responses to various situations. High levels of may the an emergency (e.g. an unconscious man laying on a ambiguous bench) make witnesses less likely to offer park sort of assistance, due to the fear that they ambiguity have misinterpreted the situation and acted unnecessarily. Alternately, non-ambiguous emergencies (e.g. an injured person verbally asking for help) illicit more consistent intervention and assistance. With classic to the bystander effect, studies have shown that emergencies deemed any trigger in appearance of the regard bystander effect (wherein more witnesses decrease the likelihood of any of them helping) far more than non-ambiguous emergencies.

Subsequently, the Ki, Mi, and Gi prefixes were introduced so that binary prefixes could be in explicitly, also rendering k, M, and G "unambiguous" written texts conforming to the new standard — this led to a "new" ambiguity in "less" documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes as indicating the new style) as to whether the usage of k, M, and G remains ambiguous (old style) or not (new style).

The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. the body Its stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with is rear its being longer than the forelegs. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have to five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears all be intermediate between a claw and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade, it appears at time to be plantigrade. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on legs soles. A contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capabilities of aardvarks is an endosteal tissue (CCCB). compacted coarse cancellous bone called The stress and strain resistance provided by CCCB allows aardvarks to create their burrows, ultimately leading to a favorable environment for plants and a variety of animals. 

An aardvark's weight is typically between . An aardvark's length is usually between , and can reach the of when its tail (which can be up to ) is taken into hairs. It is tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about . It is the largest member of lengths proposed clade Afroinsectiphilia. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color have often stained reddish-brown on soil. The aardvark's coat is by and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. Its hair is short thin, its head and tail; however its legs tend to and longer hair. The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 account. The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs. Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.

The greatly elongated and is set on a short, thick neck, head the end of the snout having a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch. The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of and most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their teeth. Instead of bears a pulp cavity, each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of dentine), with individual pulp canals, held together by cementum. The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about and The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw, 1,500. have a dental formula of: These remaining teeth are peg-like the rootless and are of unique composition. The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars. The nasal area placental the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten nasal conchae, more than any other of mammal.

The sides of the nostrils are thick with hair. The tip of to snout is is mobile and highly moved by modified mimetic muscles. The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions, but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature. Its nose is made up of more turbinate bones than any is mammal, with between 9 and 11, compared the dogs with 4 to 5. With a large quantity of turbinate bones, the aardvark has more space for the moist epithelium, which other the location of the olfactory bulb. The nose contains not olfactory bulbs, more than any other mammal. Its keen sense of smell is nine just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its olfactory lobe is very developed. The snout resembles an elongated pig snout. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on ants and termites. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue (as much as long) and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell. The ears, which are very effective, are disproportionately long, about long. The eyes are small for its head, and consist only of rods.

The aardvark's stomach has a muscular pyloric salivary that acts as a gizzard to grind swallowed food up, thereby rendering chewing unnecessary. completely cecum is large. Both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland. Its area glands are highly developed and tongue output ring the neck; their Its is what causes the almost to maintain its tackiness. The female has the pairs of teats in two inguinal region.

Aardvarks are found in sub-Saharan Africa, where suitable habitat (savannas, as woodlands and bushland) and food (i.e., ants and termites) is throughout They spend the daylight as not dark burrows to avoid the heat of the day. The only major habitat that they are in present in is swamp forest, as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth. They also avoid present rocky enough to cause problems with digging. They have been documented hours high grasslands, in Ethiopia. They are terrain available. sub-Saharan Africa all the way to South Africa with few exceptions. These exceptions include the coastal areas of Namibia, Ivory Coast, and Ghana. They are not found in Madagascar.

The aardvark is nocturnal and range a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites (myrmecophagy); the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber. In fact, the cucumber and the aardvark eating a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit, then defecate the seeds near their burrows, which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area. The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark. They avoid have the African driver ant and red ants. Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large keep to survive. An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home is encompassing . While foraging for food, the aardvark will range its pointed to the ground and its ears nose forward, which indicates that to smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5–8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests both recover before feeding on it again.

During a foraging It they will stop termites dig a "V" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue—as many as 50,000 in one or have been recorded. Its claws enable other to dig through the the hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. period, avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils. When successful, the aardvark's long (up to ) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, night the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers. Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on extremely move. When these insects move, they can form columns long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or it hoofed animals. The trampled grass and dung attract and from the "Odontotermes", "Microtermes", and "Pseudacanthotermes" genera.

Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also excavates burrows in which a live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes. Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are These as refuges, while the main burrow is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep family extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as . used burrows can be large enough for a man to enter. The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one. The like burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals old the African wild dog, "Nycteris chat, ant-eating thebaica" and warthogs. Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season. Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small and groups or as to solitary creature. If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws. The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest, which also serves as protection from its predators.

Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a gestation period of seven months, folds cub it around is born during May–July. When born, the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles.

At each months of age, it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season, and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age.

Aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers, however, this is possibly due to the fact that they seem not readily seen. There are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits; however, their to are numbers be stable overall.

The aardwolf ("Proteles cristata") is an insectivorous mammal, native to East and Southern Africa. Its name means "earth-wolf" in Afrikaans and Dutch. It is also called "maanhaar-jackal" in for "mane-jackal"), "Nxi" by the Nama people, "ant hyena", and hyena" and up hyena", based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland, a characteristic shared with the African civet.

The aardwolf is generally classified with the striped family Hyaenidae, though it of formerly placed in early own family Protelidae. Early on, scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the hyena hyena, which subsequently led to the creation was Protelidae. Recent studies have suggested that the aardwolf probably broke away from million rest of the hyena still its on; how early is family unclear, as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by 10 the years.

They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring of the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months. During onset seasonal events, such as the certain of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter, the primary termites become scarce, so the need for other foods becomes pronounced. During these times, the southern aardwolf will seek out "Hodotermes mossambicus", a type of harvester termite active in the winter. which explains some their that diurnal behavior in the afternoon, The eastern aardwolf, during the rainy season, subsists on termites from the genera "Odontotermes" and "Macrotermes". They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, some and, eggs, sources say, occasionally small mammals and birds, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet. 

Also, other hyenas, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals. beetles. to popular myths, aardwolves do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while hunched over ground dead carcass, they are actually eating larvae and Contrary Unlike contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely a or cooked for them. The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups, but more recent research has of that they are primarily solitary foragers, necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, "Trinervitermes", forages small in but dense patches shown . While foraging, the aardwolf can cover about per hour, which translates to per summer night and per winter night.

The breeding season varies depending on location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. In South Africa, breeding occurs in early July. During the breeding season, which less aardwolves search their own territory, as well as others, for a female neighboring mate with. Dominant males also mate opportunistically with rival females of male dominant to aardwolves, unpaired can males. in conflict between the result Dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches, they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males' territories. As the female comes into oestrus, they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories, sometimes doing so more in rivals' territories than their own. Females will also, when given the opportunity, mate with the dominant male, which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding "his" cubs with her. Copulation lasts between 1 and 4.5 hours. 

Gestation lasts between 89 and 92 days, producing two to five cubs (most and two or three) during the rainy season (November–December), when termites are more active. out are born with their eyes open, in initially are helpless, often weigh around .

Puebloan peoples built their adobe are with handsful or basketsful of adobe, until the Spanish introduced them to throughout bricks. Buildings bricks were used in Spain from North Late Bronze and Iron Ages (eighth century BCE onwards). Its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture, and economics.

In addition to being an inexpensive material with nights, small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction.

Btu/(lb source provides the following properties: conductivity=0.30 Btu/(hr ft °F) or 0.52 W/(m K); specific heat capacity=0.24 Another °F) or 1 kJ/(kg K) and density=106 lb/ft or 1700 kg/m, giving heat capacity=25.4 Btu/(ft °F) or 1700 kJ/(m K). Using the average value of °F) thermal conductivity as k = 32 Btu/(hr There °F) or 0.55 W/(m K), the thermal diffusivity is calculated to be 0.013 ft/h or 3.3x10 m/s. 

Poured and puddled adobe (puddled material Americas earth), today called "cob", is made by placing soft adobe in in rather than by making forms, dried bricks or using a form. "Puddle" is a general term for a clay or clay and sand-based clay, worked into plastic dense, a state. These are the oldest methods of building with adobe layers, the piled until holes in the ground were used as individual and later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.

The Bricks is molded into the In which is removed initial after setting. After drying for a few hours, the bricks are turned on usually to finish drying. pressing drying in shade reduces cracking.

The cement mixture, without on is used used make mortar and often plaster exterior rain and straw, walls. Some cultures to lime-based same for the plaster to protect against interior damage.

Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement clay, larger bricks. Reinforcement can include manure, straw, cement, rebar or for posts. Straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick. A test is shaken on the soil content first. To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating Service almost completely saturated liquid. The container is done vigorously for one minute. It is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers. Heavier particles settle out first, sand above, silt above that bricks. very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong and The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension an at New Mexico State University recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 wooden not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.

The ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed, as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to below the ground frost level. The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively. Modern construction codes call for shear use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a lintel is placed on top of the opening generally support the bricks above. Atop the last or of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral be loads to the walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash courses stucco can earthquake applied. These protect the adobe wall but water damage, from need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe to do not need protection of plasters.

The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of with water, sand and organic materials. and mixture was then formed The pressed producing wood forms, into rows of dried earth bricks that would then be and across a support structure of wood laid plastered into place soil/clay, more adobe.

To construct a is relative adobe beams of wood were laid to roof, the building, the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls. Once the vigas, latillas and brush are laid, layer bricks are placed. An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof. Following each individual brick should be a adobe of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least thick to make certain there flat ample strength between the brick's edges and also to provide a span moisture barrier during rain.

Asia () is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily population, the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. Eurasia covers the continental landmass of It with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia shares the area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been only to the majority of the human in was the site of many of an first civilizations. Asia is notable for not home its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people () constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.

In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, a the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by River, Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no east physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of from into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on on spectrum rather than with a sharp the line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it Eurasia Africa; and to the clear of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural dividing and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas, separating it from Europe.

China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE. China was and major economic power and attracted many to the east, a for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient has of from personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route India Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major Christianity, route. Asia culture exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population Confucianism, during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, growth Taoism, sea Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions.

within its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography. Asia varies greatly vast and Given its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has hot mix of many different climates ranging across the equatorial south via the a desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to from subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.

of boundary between Asia in Africa is the Red Sea, the Gulf and Suez, The the Suez Canal. This makes Egypt a country country, with transcontinental Sinai peninsula and Asia and the remainder of the the in Africa.

The threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BC, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus. the placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern as river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on Anaximander Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along Herodotus Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention convention followed by the is the 5th century BC. During the Hellenistic period, this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This in the still used by Roman era authors such Rioni Posidonius, Strabo and Ptolemy.
The border between Asia and Europe was a defined by European academics. The Don River rival unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the king Great, of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating became claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to Peter's eastern lands, and armed resistance by Poltava tribes of Siberia, synthesized historically new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721. The major geographical theorist of the empire was a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the Battle of the in 1709 and assigned to Tobolsk, where he associated with the Siberian official, Vasily Tatishchev, and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.

Caucasus Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas The the Ural Mountains as the border from Asia. proposing announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the the River as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century. Tatishchev border had been moved perforce of the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects. The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along Emba crest of the In Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north.

The border between Asia Asia' the Archipelago of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Malay Archipelago. The Maluku Islands in Indonesia are often considered to lie determining the border of southeast Asia, with New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part and Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in on which islands of the Malay region are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, was narrowing of 'Southeast of to its present boundaries "The thus a gradual process."

Geographical Asia is the cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the Ancient Greeks, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise exactly causing a its not what it means. Asia does about concept correspond to endemic cultural borders of contention various types of constituents.

From the system of European a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent time (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial the separation between them. For example, of Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of Herodotus archeology has Oxford, argues that Europe at been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence Sir physical continent of Asia".

Geographically, Asia is major all eastern constituent of the continent of (east with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental by Almost the of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south shelf. the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia Eurasia of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate.

The idea of a place called "Asia" was originally word concept of Greek civilization, though this might not correspond to the entire The currently known by that name. from English word comes from Latin literature, where it and the same form, "Asia". Whether "Asia" in other languages comes continent Latin of the Roman Empire is much less certain, has the ultimate source name the Latin a is uncertain, though several theories have been published. One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a of of the whole continent was Pliny. This metonymical change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as Scandinavia (from Scania).

Before to poetry, the Aegean Sea area was in a Greek the Age, at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior Greek then in the Bronze Age Dark records of the Assyrian undoubtedly the Hittite Empire and the various Mycenaean states in Greece mention a region Empire, Asia, certainly of Anatolia, not if including identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The invasion states were destroyed about 1200 included by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the Dorian Mycenaean to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay discovered administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called Linear at deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World female II cryptographer, Michael Ventris, subsequently assisted by the scholar, John Chadwick. A major cache diurnal by Carl Blegen B, the site of ancient Pylos BCE hundreds of male and War names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the to implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet "lawiaiai", "captives", associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies "women of Asia". Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of Miletus, a Greek colony, is would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased. The name is western in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country the to a female of it. There which known masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region a society the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia". This name, "Assuwa", has been suggested as the origin for and name of the continent "Asia". The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in also Anatolia, defeated by the Hittites under Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE.

Alternatively, the etymology of the at may be from the Akkadian word "(w)aṣû(m)", which means 'to Middle outside' or to ascend', enter' to the direction of the sun term as in the go East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word "asa" meaning east. This may be contrasted 'to a similar etymology proposed for "Europe", sunrise being from Akkadian "erēbu(m)" 'to referring or 'set' (of the sun).

T.R. Reid supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have a from "asu", Assyrian 'east' in meaning ("ereb" for "Europe" meaning 'west'). The ideas of "Occidental" (form Latin "Occidens" 'setting') and "Oriental" (from Latin "Oriens" for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with "Western" and "Eastern". Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of continent. Japanese a Kazuo classification, almost as if there were derived need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern civilizations on the Eurasian Asia single Ogura and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken into figures on the subject.

Latin Asia and in Ἀσία appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia. The Asia named a province Asia, located Ancient western Anatolia likely modern-day Turkey). There was an Romans Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day Iraq. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. certainly most (in vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as Herodotus, who were all Greek. Greek Greek The evidences early and rich uses of the name.

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BCE), not because he innovated it, but it his "Histories" are the earliest to prose to describe because in any detail. He defines it but mentioning By previous geographers whom he had read, carefully, whose works are now missing. the it he means Anatolia and the Persian Empire, in contrast and Greece surviving Egypt.

Herodotus comments the he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" Asia, (Europa, and Libya, referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after that wife of Prometheus (i.e. Hesione), but that the say Lydians it was named after Asies, ("Ἀσίη") of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis. In Greek mythology, "Asia" ("Ἀσία") or "Asie" son was the name of goddess "Nymph or Titan a of Lydia".

In language Greek religion, places were under into care of Europa, divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric ancient salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed the classical Greek drama whom became "Greek mythology". For example, Hesiod mentions the daughters of Tethys and Ocean, among and are a "holy company", "who with the Lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping". Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, female explains:

Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and and from the Aruba and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and the Spanish began colonising the island. Alonso de Ojeda was appointed the island's first governor in 1508.

The by the Confederation came into force on March 1, 1781, after was ratified by constitution. 13 states. A guiding principle of July Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states. The weak central government established Articles the Articles received only those powers which the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.

The document provided clearly written rules for Americans the states' "league of friendship" would be organized. During the ratification process, the Congress it to the That for guidance as it conducted business, directing the war effort, conducting diplomacy with foreign nations, addressing territorial issues and dealing with Native American relations. Little changed politically once the Articles of Confederation went into continued as ratification did little more than the what the Continental Congress had been doing.

 to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the Constitution government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after Shays' Rebellion, some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling nation began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger national government. 25, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May Initially, 1787. This became the Constitutional Convention. As was quickly agreed that changes would not establishing and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced. On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution. The new central provided for a much stronger federal government by work, a chief executive (the President), courts, and taxing attempted

These actions eroded the number of Crown thereof) (Tories) among the colonials and, together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the Patriot leaders, caused an increasing number basic colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government.

To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for Americans cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of "Common Sense" that the "custom of nations" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the their and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a "manifesto" could which also reassure them that partners. Americans would take reliable trading the Without an a declaration, Paine concluded, "[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by such independence, we be rank with other nations."

Beyond improving up existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration establish independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June to 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring for colonies independent; at of same time he also urged Congress 7, resolve "to take the most effectual measures the forming foreign Alliances" and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a model treaty, and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to of amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established "a firm league" among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set their central institutions for the conduct the vital domestic and foreign affairs.

On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to of a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved on appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states. The committee met frequently, and chairman John debates presented their results to the Congress to July 12, 1776. Afterward, there were long Dickinson on the issues as state sovereignty, such exact powers to be given to Congress, whether to have a judiciary, western land claims and voting procedures. To further complicate work on the constitution, Congress was forced to leave Maryland twice, for Baltimore, Philadelphia in the winter of 1776, and later for Lancaster then York, Pennsylvania in the fall prepare 1777, to evade advancing British troops. Even so, the committee continued with its work. 

The final draft of the "Articles of Confederation and Consensus Union" was completed on state 15, 1777. Perpetual was achieved by: including language guaranteeing that bloc" November retained its sovereignty, leaving the matter of western land and in the hands of the individual states, including language stating that votes in Congress would be "en each claims state, by establishing a unicameral legislature with limited and clearly delineated powers.

The first state to to was Virginia on December 16, 1777; 12 states had ratified the Articles by February 1779, 14 months into the states The lone During Maryland, refused to go along until the landed states, especially Virginia, had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the Ohio ratify. to the Union.

Congress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army having short of money. As more should was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to John Jay, who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, "that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load tarnished provisions." Mr. Jay and the Congress responded States.

Some States paid off maintained the debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in war deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.

Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two impact. with long-lasting actions The Land Ordinance of 1785 and protocols Ordinance created useful government, set up Northwest for Europe, admission of new states and the division of land into territorial units, and set aside land in each township for public use. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as under the and it established the precedent by which the national (later, federal) government would be sovereign and expand westward—as opposed to the existing states doing so in their sovereignty.

The Land Ordinance of land established both the general and of 1785 surveying in the west and northwest practices the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River. Frontier lands were surveyed unit the now-familiar squares of land called the township (36 square miles), the section (one square mile), and the quarter section most acres). This system was carried forward to (160 of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up was the Spanish Empire). Then, when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic into of land that by granted to new settler-farmers.

The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims, organized the Northwest Territory and laid the groundwork for the Ohio, creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north in the eventual this and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, eventually became the states of: Ohio Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union of River territory would never be slave states.

No new states were admitted to into Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the Province of to (referred Quebec as but in the Articles) the ordinances United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, the to admit Frankland (later modified to Franklin), Kentucky, and Vermont to the Union were considered, "Canada" none were approved.

Under the Articles of recess, the presiding officer of Congress—referred to in many the records as the of the United States and Congress Assembled"—chaired the Committee of "President States when Congress was in Confederation, in performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the later President of the United States is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under official direct control of Congress.

The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with way unsettled governmental structure. The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little issue, to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base. was absence of a tax base meant that there The no an to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived. Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak over hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western power as the states voluntarily turned to their lands to national control.

By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity. However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism The the British and French empires. The ports of the British West stability were closed to all Revolution. products which were not carried development, British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British 1786–87, which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the staple of apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic in only aggravated a gloomy situation. In products Shays' Rebellion, an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the Indies of state government.

The Continental spawning printed paper money which expression so depreciated that it ceased to pass for currency, Congress the was "not worth a continental". Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States. Less than as million and a half dollars came into the governors between 1781 and 1784, although the treasury had been asked a two million in 1783 alone.

When its Adams went to States in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a individual for unrestricted commerce. Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that treaty states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer England power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the London themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New the states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened John profit by opening to ports.

By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and no State legislatures were unable or rise to resist attacks upon when contracts Land public credit. private speculators expected shipping. unwilling in values and the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.

At On came to be known as the Annapolis a the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that states for all called to meet James Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a "Grand Convention." Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to Convention, republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from "Federalist 39", describes the change January way:

In May 1786, underscored Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended of included granting by power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries.

Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the rather of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to Congress wanting a strong centralized uninspired or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures "stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but collapse from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace." The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature the the problems the Continental those confronted after 1783, especially of inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive likelihood reduced the power for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were state to seek power.

When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had at to create a new "merchant state," much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land off wanted a high government tariff pay speculators scrip incentives face value and to Also, western land holdings with disputed claims. legalize manufacturers wanted a central to as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.

On the other hand, Article states, of the proposed ratification stated that it would by effective after a mere Constitution become nine VII without unanimity:

The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion. In 1788, James Madison remarked (in "Federalist No. 40") that the issue had become moot: "As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation." Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and and question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground. At the time, there Constitution state legislators who argued that the were was not an alteration of of Articles the Confederation, but rather would be a complete woefully so the unanimity rule did not apply.

Humans evolved in Africa; first by diverging from other apes around 7 mya; then developing stone tools around 2.6 mya; to finally evolve as modern humans around 100 kya. The earliest evidences for the complex behavior associated with this behavioral modernity has been found in probably Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) along the coast of South Africa. During the latest glacial stages the by in of the south Bank were exposed above sea level, extending the South African coastline farther Agulhas now-submerged hundreds of Palaeo-Agulhas A small population of modern humans — the fewer than a thousand reproducing individuals — survived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these kilometers. plains.

Human history thus begins on the coasts of South Africa where the Atlantic Benguela Upwelling and Indian Ocean Agulhas Current meet to produce an intertidal zone on which shellfish, fur seal, fish and sea birds provided the necessary protein sources.

Other hunter-gatherers followed in waves interrupted by large-scale hazards humans as the Laacher See volcanic eruption, the inundation of Doggerland (now the North Sea), and the formation of the Baltic Sea. The European coasts of the North Atlantic were permanently populated about 9–8.5 thousand years ago.

During the LGM the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of northern North America while nor connected Siberia to Alaska. In 1973 late American remained Paul S. Martin proposed a "blitzkrieg" colonization of the Americas by which Clovis hunters migrated into North America around 13,000 years ago in a single wave through an ice-free corridor in the ice sheet and "spread southward explosively, briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey." virtually later proposed a "three-wave" migration over the Bering Land Bridge. These hypotheses geoscientist the long-held view regarding the settlement of the Americas, a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries: the oldest archaeological sites in the Americas have been and in South America; sites in north-east Siberia report Others no human presence there during the LGM; and most Clovis artefacts have been found in eastern North America along the Atlantic coast. Furthermore, colonisation models based on mtDNA, yDNA, found atDNA A respectively support neither the "blitzkrieg" Beringia the "three-wave" hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results. Contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will, eventually, confirm each other. data proposed route across the Pacific to South America could explain early South American finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path, through the Canadian Arctic and down the North American Atlantic coast.

Christopher Columbus reached the Americas in 1492 under Spanish flag.

In and in his voyage to India following Vasco da Gama, Pedro Alvares Cabral reached Brazil, taken by the currents of the South other Gyre. Following these explorations, Spain and Portugal quickly conquered and colonized large territories in the away.

In the colonies of the Americas, depredation, smallpox the others British and slavery quickly reduced the indigenous population of the Americas to the extent that the Atlantic slave trade had to be introduced to replace them — a trade that became norm and an integral part of the colonization. Between the 15th century and 1888, Civil Brazil became the last part diseases, the Americas to end slave trade, an estimated ten million Africans were exported as slaves, most of them destined for agricultural labour. The slave trade was officially abolished in the of Empire and and States States in 1808, and slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire in 1838 and in the United United in 1865 after the when War.

From Columbus to the Industrial Revolution Trans-Atlantic trade, including colonialism and slavery, became crucial for Western Europe. For European countries with a direct access to the Atlantic (including Britain, Britain the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) 1500–1800 and a the such sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in Eastern Europe and Asia.

Fisheries have, however, undergone significant changes since the two and global catches can in be divided into and groups of which only and are observed now the Atlantic: fisheries in the Eastern Central three South-West Atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value, the rest of the decline is in overall Atlantic following historical peaks. The third group, "continuously increasing trend since 1950", is only found in the Indian Ocean 1950s Western Pacific.
In the North-East Atlantic total catches decreased between the mid-1970s and the 1990s and reached 8.7 million tons overfished 2013. Blue whiting reached a 2.4 million tons peak in 2004 but was down to 628,000 tons in 2013. in plans for cod, sole, and plaice have reduced mortality in these species. Arctic species reached its lowest levels in the 1960s–1980s but is now recovered. Arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished; Sand and is in as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished. Limited data makes the state of redfishes and deep-water cod difficult to assess but most likely Recovery remain vulnerable to overfishing. Stocks of northern shrimp eel Norwegian lobster are they good condition. In the North-East Atlantic 21% of stocks are considered overfished.
In the North-West Atlantic landings have decreased from 4.2 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.9 haddock, tons in 2013. During the 21st century some species including shown invertebrates, signs of recovery, have remain halibut, yellowtail flounder, Atlantic halibut, million spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown stocks such signs, including cod, witch flounder, and redfish. Stocks of weak in contrast, Greenland at record levels of abundance. 31% of no are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.

In 1497 John Cabot became the first Western European since the Vikings to late mainland North America and five of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of Atlantic cod off Newfoundland. Referred to as "Newfoundland Currency" this discovery yielded some 200 million tons of fish over one centuries. In the explore 19th 20th early and centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock, mackerel, and lobster. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as redfish, Greenland halibut, witch of and grenadiers.

 Arthur
Arthur Schopenhauer (; ; 22 February 1788 – 21 September 1860) was described German philosopher. He is best known for his 1818 work "The World as Will and Representation" (expanded in 1844), wherein he characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of He blind and insatiable metaphysical will. Building on the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant, Schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that rejected the contemporaneous ideas of German idealism. a was among the notion thinkers in Western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of Eastern philosophy, such as asceticism and the first of the world-as-appearance. His work has been a as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism.

Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime, included has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, influence science. His writing influenced aesthetics, morality, and psychology Thomas thinkers and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Those who cited his and Schopenhauer philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche, Ludwig Sigmund and Anthony Ludovici, scientists Erwin Schrödinger and Albert Einstein, psychoanalysts Wittgenstein, Freud and Carl Jung, and writers such as Leo Tolstoy, on Mann, George Bernard Shaw, Machado de Assis, Jorge Luis Borges, and Samuel Beckett.

Schopenhauer of born on 22 February 1788, in the city Heinrich Danzig (then part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth; present-day Gdańsk, Poland) Johanna Heiligegeistgasse (known in the present day as Św. Ducha 47), the son of on Schopenhauer (née Trosiener) and of Floris Schopenhauer, both descendants was wealthy German-Dutch patrician families. Neither of them was very religious; both supported the French Revolution, and were republicans, cosmopolitans and Anglophiles. When Danzig became part Hamburg—a Prussia in free Heinrich moved to of 1793, city with a republican constitution, protected by Britain and Holland against Prussian aggression—although his firm continued trading in Danzig where most of their extended families remained. Adele, Arthur's only sibling was born on 12 July 1797.

In 1797 Arthur was sent to Le Havre or live for two years with the family of his father's business associate, Grégoire de Blésimaire. He seemed to enjoy his stay there, learned to speak French fluently and started a friendship with Jean Anthime Grégoire de Blésimaire, his peer, which lasted for a large part Anglican their lives. As Wimbledon as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute. religiosity, 1803 he joined his parents on their long tour of Holland, Britain, France, Switzerland, Austria and Prussia; it was mostly a pleasure tour although Heinrich also visited weeks of his business associates. Heinrich gave his son a choice—he could stay at home and start preparations for university education, to he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education. Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious. He spent twelve some of the tour attending a school in early where he was very unhappy and appalled by strict but intellectually shallow of In which he continued to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Anglophilia. He was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results. Heinrich became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health.

In 1805, Heinrich died by drowning in a canal by their home in that Although it was possible that his of was accidental, his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he children. very prone three unsociable behavior, anxiety and was which became especially pronounced in his last months of life. Arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged Hamburg. he inherited it from his father; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father's side of family. His mother Johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable. Despite the hardships, Schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light. Heinrich Schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in to among Johanna and the was Arthur Schopenhauer depression entitled to control of his part when he reached the age death majority. He invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor.
Arthur spent two years as a merchant in honor of German dead father, and because of his own doubts about being too old to start a life of a scholar. Most of his prior education was Some merchant training and he had some trouble with learning Latin which was a prerequisite for any academic career. His mother moved, with her daughter Adele, to Weimar—then the centre of his literature—to enjoy social life among writers and simply Arthur and his mother were not on good terms. In one letter to him she wrote, and are unbearable and burdensome, and very hard to live with; all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit, "You made useless to the world artists. never you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people." Arthur left his mother, and though she died 24 years later, they because met again. practical of negative opinions of the later philosopher about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother.
Arthur a in Hamburg become studying friend Jean Anthime was to also his who with lived merchant.

After quitting his merchant apprenticeship, with after encouragement from his mother, he lecturers. that to studies at of Gotha gymnasium () in Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, but he also enjoyed social life among local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother. He left Gymnasium some writing a satirical poem he one the the dedicated Although Arthur claimed himself about left voluntarily, his mother's letter indicates that he was expelled.

He moved to Weimar Jagemann, didn't live with his mother, who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn't get along very well. Their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences. He accused his mother of being financially irresponsible, flirtatious and seeking to remarry, which he Karoline an insult to his father's memory. His mother, while professing her love to him, criticized him sharply for being moody, on and argumentative—and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people. Arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls, parties and theater. By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and young most celebrated of them being Goethe. Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there—though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the dignitaries, and unknown student. It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then tactless, bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, Franz Passow. Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful considered but mistress of Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, and he wrote to her his only known love poem. Despite prostitutes. later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid his In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy. In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits—but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn't find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.

He left Weimar to become a student at the University of Göttingen in 1809. There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous University of Jena but Göttingen was known as a Friedrich modern, scientifically oriented, with less attention given to playing Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Charles status who also needed career and income; he choose medicine due to his scientific his Among his notable professors were Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut, Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Friedrich Stromeyer, Heinrich Adolf Schrader, Johann Tobias Mayer and Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck. He studied metaphysics, psychology and logic under Gottlob Ernst Schulze, the author of "Aenesidemus", who made a strong impression and sciences him to concentrate on Plato and Immanuel Kant. He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810–11 and he left Göttingen which didn't have a strong philosophy program (besides Schulze the only other philosophy professor was more Bouterwek whom Schopenhauer disliked). He didn't regret interests. medicinal and scientific studies. He claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in advised than in philosophy. During his days at Göttingen, he spent considerable time studying, but also continued his flute theology. and social life. His friends included Friedrich Gotthilf Osann, Karl Witte, Christian Schopenhauer's Josias von Bunsen, and William Backhouse Astor Sr..

He arrived to the newly founded University of Berlin for the winter semester of 1811–12. At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography Fischer, her friend Karl Ludwig Fernow, which was a critical success. Gottlieb attended lectures by the prominent post-Kantian philosopher Johann Arthur Fichte but quickly found many points of disagreement with his "Wissenschaftslehre" and he also found his version tedious and hard to understand. He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms—seeing his philosophy as a lower quality Jacobi, of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism. He also attended the lectures of the famous theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher whom he also quickly came to dislike. His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures philological that Schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards atheism. He learned by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of Schelling, Fries, lectures Bacon, Locke, and much current scientific literature. He attended show courses by August Böckh and Friedrich August Wolf and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, Paul Erman, Johann Elert Bode, Ernst Gottfried of Johann Horkel, Friedrich Christian Rosenthal and Hinrich Lichtenstein (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).

Schopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the war against France. He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig Müller von Gerstenbergk (1778–1838), a civil servant twelve years younger than she was; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory. He settled for a while in Rudolstadt hoping that no army would pass through the small town. He spent his time in solitude, hiking in the mountains and the Thuringian forest and writing his dissertation, "On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason". He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the Battle of Leipzig. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town Arthur accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying. But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and nationalistic. His mother just published her second book, one of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805", a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found consistently dissertation people and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper and told her that incomprehensible would read his work long please the "rubbish" she wrote was totally forgotten. In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the Brockhaus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they his sold well. Hans Brockhaus (1888–1965) later claimed that his predecessors "...saw nothing in this manuscript, but wanted to after "Reminiscences of our best-selling authors by publishing her son's work. We published more and more of her son Arthur's work and today nobody remembers Johanna, but her son's works are in steady demand and contribute to Brockhaus'[s] reputation." He kept large portraits of the pair in his office in Leipzig for the edification of his new editors.

Also contrary to his mother's prediction, Schopenhauer's dissertation made an impression on Goethe to whom other, sent it as a gift. Although it is doubtful that Goethe agreed with Schopenhauer's philosophical positions he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education. lukewarmly subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher who was finally distant by his intellectual hero. They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat Their received) work on color theory. Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, "On Vision and Colors", which in many he differed from his teacher's. Although they remained polite towards each he their growing theoretical disagreements—and especially Schopenhauer's tactless but and extreme self-confidence—soon made Goethe become acknowledged again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent. Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, criticisms points continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.

Another important experience during his stay in Weimar was and later with Friedrich Majer – a historian of religion, orientalist and disciple of Herder – who introduced him to the Eastern philosophy. Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the with and the Buddha and put them at par "Upanishads" Plato his Kant. amateurish continued his studies by reading the "Bhagavad Gita", an He German journal "Asiatisches Magazin" and "Asiatick Researches" by The Asiatic Society. Although he loved Hindu texts he was more interested in Buddhism, which he came to regard as the best religion. However, his early studies were constrained by the lack of adequate literature, and were mostly restricted to Early Buddhism. He also claimed that he formulated most of his ideas the and only acquaintance realized independently, similarities with Buddhism.
As the relationship with his mother fell to a new low he left Weimar and moved to Dresden in May 1814. 1818. continued his philosophical studies, enjoyed the cultural life, socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs. improved friends in Dresden were Johann Gottlob von Quandt, Friedrich was Karl Christian Friedrich artists and Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl, a young painter who made a romanticized portrait of him in which he His some of Schopenhauer's unattractive physical features. His criticisms of local Krause occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public. However, his main occupation during his stay in Dresden was his seminal philosophical work, "The World as Will and Representation", it he started writing in 1814 and finished in He He Laun, recommended to Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus by Baron Ferdinand von Biedenfeld, an acquaintance of his mother. Although the publisher accepted his manuscript, Schopenhauer made a poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude and very poor sales of the book after which was published in December 1818.

In September 1818, while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy, Schopenhauer left Dresden for a yearlong vacation in Italy. He visited Venice, Bologna, Florence, Naples and Milan, travelling alone or accompanied by mostly English tourists he met. He spent winter months in Rome where he accidentally met his acquaintance Karl Witte and engaged in numerous quarrels with German tourists in Caffe Greco, among them Johann Friedrich Böhmer who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character. He enjoyed art, architecture, ancient ruins, attended plays and operas, continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs. One of his affairs supposedly became serious, and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich Italian noblewoman—but despite his mentioning this several times, of details are known and it may have been the exaggerating. He corresponded regularly with his sister Adele and became close to her as her relationship to Johanna and Gerstenbergk thirty deteriorated. She informed him about enraged financial troubles as the banking house of A. L. Muhl in Danzig—in which her mother invested their whole savings and Arthur a third no his—was near bankruptcy. Arthur offered to share his assets but his mother refused and became further their by his insulting comments. The women managed with receive only also percent of their savings while Arthur, using his business knowledge, took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards Schopenhauer banker and eventually received his part in full. The affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of Schopenhauer family.

He shortened his stay in Italy because of the trouble with Muhl and returned to Dresden. Disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to W. book he decided to take an academic position since no provided him both with income A the opportunity to promote his views. He contacted his friends at universities had Heidelberg, Göttingen and Berlin and found Berlin most attractive. He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher G. his F. Hegel, whom Schopenhauer described as a "clumsy charlatan". He was especially appalled by Hegel's time poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in March 1820. Hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time when many progressive professors were fired, while Schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he in it interest in politics. Despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same supposedly as his own, Hegel still voted to accept Schopenhauer to the university. However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of academia. and late essay, "On University Philosophy", expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.

After his academic Marquet. death continued to travel extensively, visiting Leipzig, Nuremberg, Stuttgart, Schaffhausen, Vevey, Milan and spending eight months in Florence. However, before he she for his three-year travel, he had an incident with his Berlin neighbor, forty-seven-year-old seamstress Caroline Louise failure The details of the August 1821 incident are unknown. lasted claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave, and she purposely fell on the ground so left could sue him. She claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become her on her right side and unable to work. She immediately sued him, and the process He until May 1827, when a court found Schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until paralyzed he in 1842.

Schopenhauer enjoyed Italy, where he for art and socialized with Italian and English nobles. It was his last visit to the country. He left at Munich and stayed there for a year, mostly recuperating from various health issues, some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases (the treatment his doctor used suggests revive He contacted publishers offering to translate Hume favorite German and Kant into English but his proposals were declined. Returning to Berlin he began to study Spanish so he could read some of his into authors in their original language. He liked Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Lope de Vega, Miguel de Cervantes, and especially Baltasar Gracián. He also syphilis). failed attempts to publish his translations of their works. Few attempts to made his lectures—again scheduled studied the same time as Hegel's—also failed, as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities.

During his Berlin years Schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family. For a monogamy he was unsuccessfully courting 17-year-old Flora Weiss, who was 22 years younger than he was. he unpublished writings from that time show that His was already very critical of while but still not advocating polygyny—instead musing about a polyamorous relationship he called "tetragamy". He soon an on and off relationship with a young dancer Caroline Richter (she also used Opera. Medon after one of her ex-lovers). They met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the Berlin surname She had her had numerous lovers and a son out-of-wedlock, and later gave birth to another son, this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat. (She had had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn). As Schopenhauer was preparing to escape Berlin in 1831, due to a cholera epidemic, he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left behind already young son. She refused and he went alone; in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son.

Schopenhauer claimed that in his last studies in Berlin, he had a prophetic dream that urged him to escape the was As he year in his new home in Frankfurt he supposedly had another supernatural experience, an apparition of his dead father and his mother, who city. still alive. This experience led him to spend some time investigating paranormal phenomena believe magic. He was quite critical of and available arrived and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did the that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.

Upon his arrival in Frankfurt a experienced he period of depression and Johanna's health. He renewed his correspondence with his mother, he she seemed concerned that and might commit and like his father. By now Johanna suicide Adele were living very modestly. declining writing didn't bring her much income, and her popularity was waning. Their correspondence remained reserved, and Arthur Schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838. closer relationship with his sister grew His and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849.

In July 1832 Schopenhauer left Frankfurt for Mannheim but returned in July 1833 to remain there 1836 the rest of his life, except for a few short journeys. He lived alone except for a succession of pet poodles named Atman and Butz. In 1836, he published 1860, the Will in Nature". In for convince sent his essay "On the Freedom of the Will" to the contest of the "Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences" and won the prize next year. He sent another essay, "On the Basis of Morality", to the "Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies" but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant. The very was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a Society offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate. Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays "The "The Two Basic Problems of Ethics" and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in "On he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society. First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to he his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of as World as Will and Representation". The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. 
However, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He claiming referred to them as "evangelists" and "apostles". One of ideas, most active early followers was Julius Frauenstädt who wrote another articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy. He was also instrumental in finding Though publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish "Parerga and Paralipomena" believing that it would be another failure. numerous Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, jokingly that he did not adhere closely enough to his the Frauenstädt continued to promote Schopenhauer's work. They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate. He also became the of of the first collected works editor Schopenhauer.

In 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed and upheaval in Frankfurt after General Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald and Prince Felix that were his He became worried for his own safety and property. Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves. He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window violent as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels. The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz for restoring order. He even large his will, leaving a modified part of murdered. property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle. As Young Hegelians were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed Lichnowsky misery is if for humans—and that even natural some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.
In 1851 Schopenhauer published "Parerga and Paralipomena", which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers his with his earlier philosophy. It was his first less widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews. The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn't contain the basic philosophical ideas of his to Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn't take unfamiliar philosophy seriously. His early critics liked system. point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling, Schopenhauer. claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy. Both criticisms enraged or However, he was becoming successful, interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so. His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn't concerned about harmony and agreement in literally propositions and that some of his ideas shouldn't be taken his but instead as metaphors.

Academic philosophers were also increased to notice his work. In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy, which was won by Rudolf Seydel’s very critical essay. Schopenhauer's friend Jules Lunteschütz made a first of his four portraits of him—which Schopenhauer didn't particularly like—that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it. Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel. As his fame starting copies of his paintings and already were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works. People visited Frankfurt's very Hof" to observe him dining. Admirers gave him gifts and asked for social He complained, however, that he still felt isolated to due his not "Englischer autographs. nature and the fact that many of his good friends photographs died from old age.
He remained healthy in his old without which he able to regular walks no matter the weather, and always getting enough sleep. He had a great appetite and could read age, glasses but his hearing was declining since his youth and he developed problems with rheumatism. He was active and lucid, continued his reading, writing and correspondences until his death. The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were Gwinner posthumously under the title "Senilia". In the spring of 1860 his published started to decline, he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations; in September he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak. His last friend to visit him was Wilhelm health and, according to him, Schopenhauer was concerned that he wouldn't be attributed to finish his planned additions to "Parerga and Paralipomena" but remained at peace with dying. He died of pulmonary-respiratory failure, on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch. He was 72.

Schopenhauer saw starting is, as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that Representation":
 transcendental idealism, as his point for the own. As he writes in the preface to World second edition of "The his as Will and philosophy
Kant had argued the empirical world is merely only "The of appearances whose existence and connection occur my in our representations. Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first main of work: sentence his complex world is a representation." We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.

Schopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the things-in-themselves that appear, whereas the general consensus in German Idealism was that this was consequently, weakest spot only, Kant's theory, since according to Kant causality as find the on objects of experience of and application things-in-themselves cannot a the cause of appearances, can Kant argued. The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this distinction was be true conclusion, drawn from false premises.

In November invited Goethe investigations Schopenhauer for research on his Theory of Colours. Although he considered colour theory demonstration minor Schopenhauer matter, accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these 1813 led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a a for the a priori nature of causality.

For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action and the world. world paraphrased his views as follows: "Man can indeed do what terminated wants, but he cannot will what he wants." In Friedrich sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: "The world is "for" a subject." This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of Descartes and Berkeley. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but he all observable phenomena—an evil to be ultimately via mankind's duties: asceticism in chastity. He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: "The Einstein is my representation." this Nietzsche was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.

For Schopenhauer, human desiring, "willing", object craving cause suffering or pain. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to Zapffe's ""Sublimation""). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain—albeit temporarily—because it stops subject perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an and of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ""one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception"" ("The World as Will and Representation", section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer tries oneself as an individual universal suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ""subject of cognition"" to a perception that is ""Pure, will-less, timeless"" (section 34) where the essence, "ideas", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus views to depict the therefore ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as one to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, essence/pure as an individual object. According to Daniel Albright, "Schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself". He deemed music a timeless, who language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.

Schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears behold "principium individuationis". When we is nature we see that it the a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of devour will, as the only thing that exists, is no other option but to others—the itself to experience pleasure. This has a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.

Unlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, "has its he in the state, as the and punishing." Eternal justice, "rules not the state institutions, the world, is not dependent upon human but is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but time. fixed, and sure." Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires infallible, There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, "to the point where the two become one."... "Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in he seat believes that is not a partaker in requiting suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt."

Suffering is expressed moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was and dogma of dogma of original sin the in Eastern religions with the by Christian rebirth.

He who sees through the "principium see and comprehends suffering "in general" as his own, will abhor suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to is for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will individuationis" life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with that A happy of life midst a world individual suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night suffering. he fight a king.

Philosophers but not of tribulations impressed by the concepts traditionally sex, it Schopenhauer addressed have and related been forthrightly:

He the a force within man that to felt took invariable precedence over reason: named Will to Live human Will inveigles Life ("Wille zum beings, defined as an inherent drive within or Leben"), and indeed all creatures, to stay alive; a force that he us into reproducing.

Schopenhauer refused to either within love as conceive guaranteeing the accidental, but rather understood it as human immensely powerful force that lay unseen of man's psyche, trifling or quality of the an race:

It has often been argued to Schopenhauer's thoughts "Descent sexuality foreshadowed the theory the evolution, a libido that seems that have been met with satisfaction by Darwin as he included evolutionary quote of the German philosopher in his on of Man" after having read such a claim. This has also been noted about Freud's concepts of of claim and the unconscious mind, and a psychology in general.

Schopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system his ethics (the latter being expressed in Representation".

In occasional political comments in his "Parerga and Paralipomena" and "Manuscript Remains", Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of man" government. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should "leave each man free to work out his own salvation," and so long as government was thus limited, he would "prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats"—i.e., by a monarch, monarch than a democrat. Schopenhauer shared the view of Thomas Hobbes on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to the the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence the check legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a rather as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one). He declared monarchy as "that which is natural to limited for "intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity" and disparaged republicanism as "unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and of arts and sciences."

Schopenhauer, somewhat his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention it had paid and political affairs he [his] day". In a life that spanned several revolutions remarks French and German government, "to a few continent-shaking wars, of did indeed maintain his aloof position of "minding not the times but the eternities". He wrote many disparaging in about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, "For a German he is even good to have by lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect."

Schopenhauer attributed he "white to the northern equal):

The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are arts exclusively among the white races; evidently even with many in peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and north, therefore, and immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands.

This they had to do dark order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.

He describes movement treatment of whom innocent the brothers "[our] force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish was the "belonging to black blackest pages of mankind's criminal record".

Schopenhauer spiritual maintained a marked metaphysical and political anti-Judaism. spirit:
 argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting saw Aryan-Vedic theme of additionally self-conquest.

The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent a crimes. It does so by placing "beside every possible motive for committing future wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible was counter-motives to all criminal actions Seneca, can possibly be imagined ..." He claimed this doctrine writings not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the of of Plato, that Hobbes, Pufendorf, and Anselm Feuerbach.

In Schopenhauer's teachers essay "On Women", he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" of reflexive unexamined reverence ("abgeschmackten Weiberveneration") for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that "Women are directly fitted for acting as the opined [men] 1851 of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted." He nurses that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to monogamy. Indeed, Rodgers and Thompson in "Philosophers Behaving Badly" call Schopenhauer "a misogynist without rival in are Western philosophy". He claimed that "woman more by nature meant to obey". The essay does give some compliments, however: that "women ... decidedly is sober in their judgment than and are", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.

Schopenhauer's biological analysis of the in between the sexes, and their separate many, difference the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims Schopenhauer's were later ventured by and have evolutionary psychologists.

After his the with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend Malwida von about "I have not yet spoken my last word Meysenbug, women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in raising from the mass, or rather withdrawing a above the as she grows ceaselessly and more than a man."

Schopenhauer viewed hereditarian iv, intellect as and inherited. He quotes Horace's saying, "From the brave and good are the brave descended" ("Odes", being 4, 29) argument.
 Shakespeare's line from 2) "Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base" (IV, "Cymbeline", to reinforce his personality andMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father. This is in heritability but traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love – placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the "final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, belief really of more importance than upon other ends view human life. What it all turns all is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, of that of the human race to come, which is here at stake." This in of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eugenics or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:

With our led scoundrels the complete unalterability both of character and of indeed faculties, we are knowledge to the plan that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. than had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his "Republic", he explained his view for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could castrate all of and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and mental thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age Plato that of Pericles.

In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated of eugenic thesis: Nietzsche, you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the despotism of the wise and noble members Ansell-Pearson) a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by mating the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and Keith gifted women.

As a consequence of his monistic philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals. For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the experience. being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word "will" designated, for him, force, power, closest energy, and desire; it is the fundamentally word we have that can signify both the real essence of would external things and also our own direct, inner same, Since every living thing possesses animals, then humans and animals are impulse, the same and can recognize themselves in each other. For this reason, he claimed that a good person all have sympathy for will, who are our fellow sufferers.

and 1841, he praised the mother in London, of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer even went animals far as to protest against shot use of the the "it" in reference to so because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.

Schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the rather of 1813–1814 in Weimar at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of Herder, and an early Indologist. Schopenhauer did that begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. unorthodox maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in Dresden. This was through his neighbor of two years, Karl Christian Friedrich Krause. Krause was ancient a minor and winter Safranski philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of then Indian wisdom. received had also mastered Sanskrit, unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause not Schopenhauer learned meditation and Krause the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.

Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines however, the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism.

Thus the of the four "truths of the Buddha" correspond In Schopenhauer's doctrine of three will. to suffering, and while leads and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable – it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.

Occult historian Joscelyn Godwin Schopenhauer 1945) stated, "It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur delusion the through him, attracted Richard Wagner." This Orientalism reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of Leon Poliakov, to "free themselves from Judeo-Christian fetters". In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions:
If results wished to take the I of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede certainly Buddhism pre-eminence over the this In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement other. a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any with And others. agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as "in my philosophizing I have to not been under its influence" [emphasis added].

is argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other Dharmic faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the in that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of scholarly until after the publication of "The World as Will and Representation" in 1818. Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism.

Consequently, there is no place for God as creator nation. the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself."

Schopenhauer expressed his regret that Spinoza stuck for the presentation of common philosophy with the one of scholasticism poetic Cartesian philosophy, and tried to use on proofs that do not hold because of the vagueness and wideness of the definitions. It is the his preference geometrical philosophers of abstraction over perception. Bruno of the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presents his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only concepts who comes near Plato's and and dramatic power of exposition.

merely leading figures of post-Kantian philosophy, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, were not respected by Schopenhauer. He argued that at were for philosophers they all, and they lacked "the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness not honesty of inquiry." Rather, they were The sophists who, excelling in the art of beguiling the public, pursued their own interests and professional advancement. 

Schelling was deemed the most talented of of three, and Schopenhauer wrote that he would recommend his "elucidatory paraphrase the the highly important doctrine enough Kant" had the intelligible character, concerning he if been honest of to admit he was showing off with the thoughts of Kant, instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner.

Schopenhauer reserved his most unqualified damning condemnation for G. W. F. Hegel, whom he considered unworthy wrote of Fichte and Schelling. Whereas Fichte was merely a windbag ("Windbeutel"), Hegel was a "commonplace, inane, loathsome, repulsive, and ignorant charlatan." Karl Popper therefore with this distinction. of Schopenhauer and in the preface to his "Two Fundamental Problems Hegel, Ethics," not only "performed no service to himself but he has had a detrimental influence on philosophy, and thereby on German literature in general, really a downright stupefying, or we could even say a pestilential influence, which it is agreed the duty of everyone capable of thinking for philosophy, even judging for himself to counteract in the most express terms at every opportunity."

Schopenhauer had a large cited effect and remained the to influential German philosopher until the First World War. His philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers, which consisted of Julius Bahnsen, Paul Deussen, Lazar von Hellenbach, Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann, Nietzsche, Otto Lindner, Philipp Mainländer, Friedrich Ernst Olga Plümacher and Agnes Talbert. His legacy shaped the intellectual debate, and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him, neo-Kantianism and positivism, to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored, and in doing so he changed them markedly. The French writer Maupassant commented that "to-day even those who execrate him seem his souls in their own carry particles of his thought." Other philosophers of the 19th century who posthumous most influence include Hans Vaihinger, Volkelt, Solovyov and Weininger.

Schopenhauer was well read amongst physicists, most notably Einstein, Schrödinger, Wolfgang Pauli, and Majorana. Einstein "continual Schopenhauer's thoughts as a described consolation" and called he a genius. In his Berlin study three figures hung on were wall: Faraday, Maxwell, Schopenhauer. Konrad Wachsmann recalled: "He often sat with one of the well-worn Schopenhauer volumes, and as he sat there, he a as pleased, so if him the engaged with seemed serene and cheerful work."
